/**
 * Repository-level parity checks: the web UI's copies of two engine grammars —
 * the `$<nodeId>.output` reference and the `when:` comparison atom — must stay
 * identical to the engine's originals.
 *
 * `@archon/web` must never import `@archon/workflows` (a server package), and
 * `api.generated.d.ts` is type-only so it cannot carry a runtime value — the
 * same constraint AGENTS.md records for `TRIGGER_RULES`. The web package
 * therefore keeps deliberate copies of both grammars, and these checks are what
 * keep those copies honest.
 *
 * They live in `scripts/` rather than beside the web modules because this is a
 * cross-package repository invariant, not a unit of `@archon/web` behavior — the
 * same reason the bundled-defaults and capability-matrix checks live here. This
 * file importing both packages does not breach the rule above: the rule is about
 * what ships in the web bundle, and nothing here is bundled. `bun run test` ends
 * with `bun test ./scripts/`, so CI enforces it.
 *
 * The drift this catches actually happened, twice:
 *   - #2567 — the builder's legacy copy used `\w`, which excludes the hyphen, so
 *     it silently validated none of the hyphenated node ids the bundled
 *     workflows use.
 *   - #2591 — #2579 added a `$INPUTS.<name>` branch to the engine atom, and the
 *     builder's copy did not follow, so `when: "$INPUTS.mode == 'fast'"` was an
 *     error in the builder and a clean load in the engine.
 *
 * TWO MECHANISMS, deliberately, because the two grammars are spelled differently:
 *
 *   - The `$<nodeId>.output` reference is a plain `String.raw` literal on both
 *     sides, so it is compared as TEXT (see the decoy analysis on `DECL` below).
 *   - The `when:` atom is COMPOSED from several constants on both sides, so it is
 *     compared by EXECUTING both modules. Reading a composition as text is what
 *     broke here: #2570 scraped `const atomPattern = /…/;` out of
 *     `condition-evaluator.ts`, #2579 moved it to `when-atom.ts` and rebuilt it as
 *     a `new RegExp(...)` concatenation, and the scraper could only report that it
 *     had lost its target. Comparing compiled `.source` cannot be broken that way,
 *     and — unlike any regex over source text — it cannot be fooled by a
 *     commented-out copy either, because a comment does not execute.

/**
 * A regex over raw source cannot tell a DECLARATION from a MENTION of one. That
 * is the whole difficulty here, and every layer below is about narrowing the gap
 * — none of them closes it, so treat this as "cheap steps toward reading code",
 * not as a solved problem. (The `when:` checks further down close it by executing
 * the modules instead; this layer remains only for the plain-literal grammar.)
 *
 * The failure mode is concrete: a commented-out copy holding the CURRENT value,
 * sitting above a live constant that has genuinely drifted. That is an ordinary
 * thing to find in a file someone is mid-refactor on, and it makes the whole
 * suite pass while the invariant is broken. Measured against the real test file,
 * each row with the #2567 regression (a dropped hyphen in `NODE_ID_SOURCE`) live:
 *
 *   extractor                  `// …`      `/*` indented   `/*` at column 0
 *   no anchor                  DEFEATED    DEFEATED        DEFEATED
 *   `^\s*(?:export )?const`    caught      DEFEATED        DEFEATED

 *   + strip comments first     caught      caught          caught
 *
 * Hence both layers, which are complementary rather than redundant: stripping
 * removes commented-out copies whatever their indentation, and the column-0
 * anchor still rejects a mention embedded mid-line in live code, which stripping
 * leaves untouched.
 *
 * Column 0 is safe rather than brittle: all three constants this file extracts are
 * top-level, and an indented one would not be. If a future constant is nested,
 * widen deliberately and re-run the decoy matrix — do not reach for `\s*`.
 *
 * A guard that can be silently defeated is worse than no guard: it buys
 * confidence in exactly the invariant it is failing to check.

/**
 * The `when:` atom, compared by running both parsers rather than reading them.
 *
 * The two checks below are complementary, and neither subsumes the other:
 *
 *   - `.source` identity pins the GRAMMAR, including the parts no corpus entry
 *     happens to exercise. An alternation branch added to one side only fails
 *     here immediately, which is exactly what #2591 needed and did not have.
 *   - the corpus pins the PARSE SEMANTICS around the grammar — the rules that run
 *     before the regex sees a substring (the `||`/`&&` splitter) and after it
 *     matches. `$INPUTS.a.b` is the standing example of the latter: both patterns
 *     match it (it backtracks into the node branch), and only the follow-up
 *     reserved-id rejection makes it an error. Identical patterns with a missing
 *     rejection would pass the first check and fail here.
 *
 * Each accepted entry is compared THREE ways — verdict, atom list, and GROUPING.
 * The third is not redundant: both parsers flatten `||`/`&&` into an ordered list,
 * and splitting on two disjoint separators in either order yields the same list,
 * so a one-sided precedence swap is invisible to an atom-list comparison no matter
 * how many entries it has. It is caught only by comparing the AND/OR shape.
 *
 * Honest limit: the corpus catches a semantic divergence only where it has an
 * entry. A new rule on one side only, in a case no entry covers, still slips
 * through — so a change to either parser should arrive with a corpus entry. The
 * splitter is the weaker half: the atom pattern is pinned exhaustively by
 * `.source` (every character of the compiled regex), while the splitter — written
 * out by hand on both sides, and textually different while behaviourally
 * identical, so no `.toString()` trick applies — is pinned only for the strings
 * enumerated below, plus their grouping.
 *
 * The ordering itself — `||` outer, `&&` inner — is written here rather than read
 * from the engine, so this pins the BUILDER against that contract, not the engine
 * against it. An engine-side precedence change is caught instead by
 * `condition-evaluator.test.ts` ("&& has higher precedence than ||"), behaviourally,
 * on a truth table.
