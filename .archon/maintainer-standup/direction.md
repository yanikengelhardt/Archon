# Archon Direction

The maintainer-standup workflow consults this document when triaging PRs and issues to suggest which contributions align with the project and which are likely polite-decline candidates.

This file is **committed and shared by all maintainers**. Edit deliberately — direction calls live here so that PR triage stays consistent across runs and across maintainers. When declining a PR, cite the specific clause (e.g., `direction.md §single-tenant-per-install`).

## What Archon IS

- **A governed agentic automation engine.** Runs multi-step workflows that mix deterministic steps (bash/scripts) with AI agents (Claude Code SDK, Codex SDK, Pi community provider), with human approval gates and audit trails — driven remotely from Slack, Telegram, GitHub, Discord, CLI, and Web UI. Its most mature surface today is agentic **coding**; the same engine is being extended to drive general **business-operations** automation.
- **Single-tenant per install.** One isolated instance per operator or client (the deployment model is one install/VPS per client, not one install serving many tenants). Data model and runtime stay single-tenant — client isolation is at the deployment layer, not in code. Multi-**user** within an install (several humans sharing one instance, each with their own identity/credentials) is supported and is distinct from multi-**tenant**.
- **Heading toward always-on automation.** Native scheduling and event/webhook triggers are a planned primitive (tracked in the workflow-triggers PRD), enabling scheduled, event-driven, and unattended runs — including operational, non-coding work. PRs toward this direction align.
- **Platform-agnostic at the conversation layer.** Unified interface across adapters via `IPlatformAdapter`. Stream/batch AI responses in real time.
- **Workflow-driven.** Reproducible AI execution chains defined as YAML DAGs in `.archon/workflows/`. Workflows run in isolated git worktrees by default.
- **Type-safe.** Strict TypeScript everywhere. No `any` without justification.
- **Composable.** Scripts in `.archon/scripts/`, commands in `.archon/commands/`, workflows compose them.
- **Bundled defaults are reference implementations — composition is how we author them, not a stability contract we offer.** "Reference patterns" is the user-facing posture; "composable" is the authoring technique. The set demonstrates capabilities and authoring best practice, stack-agnostic so it runs on any project (rewrite: #2123). `include:` blocks stay internally consistent within a bundle release, never guaranteed across releases (declare `returns:` once #2470 lands). User copies are expected to diverge; building on a bundled block is allowed but neither mandatory nor the recommendation — the best workflows are project-specific. Repo-override by name is the pinning mechanism. Cite as `direction.md §defaults-reference-implementations`.
- **Has a community workflow marketplace.** A place for the community to share their workflows — the registry at `packages/docs-web/src/data/marketplace.ts` (each entry pinned to a commit SHA), surfaced on the docs site.
- **Self-hostable.** Bun + TypeScript runtime. SQLite by default; PostgreSQL optional. Zero external service dependencies for core operation.
- **Forge-agnostic.** GitHub is the primary forge, but Gitea and GitLab are community supported targets via community adapters at `packages/adapters/src/community/forge/`. Long-term home for outbound forge operations (PR/issue/review CRUD) is the same per-forge adapter that handles inbound webhooks. New forges land as new community adapters that implement the shared interface.

## What Archon is NOT

- **Not multi-tenant inside one install.** No per-tenant isolation, tenant multiplexing, billing, or SaaS scaffolding within a single instance — serve multiple clients by running one install per client. (Per-**user** identity and credentials within an install already exist and are in scope; that is not multi-tenancy.) PRs adding in-process multi-tenant isolation or billing conflict with the per-install model.
- **Not a hosted service.** No proprietary backend dependencies. Self-hosted by design.
- **Not a general-purpose chat UI.** Adapters are conversation surfaces for *workflow execution*, not standalone chat experiences.
- **Not a replacement for the AI coding agent itself.** Archon orchestrates Claude Code / Codex / Pi — it doesn't reimplement them.
- **Not opinionated about the dev environment.** No mandatory editor integrations, framework lock-in, or Docker requirement beyond what users opt into.
- **Not a deployment-infrastructure product.** Caddy is the single maintained reference reverse proxy (`--profile cloud`). Alternative proxies and infra recipes (Traefik, Nginx, k8s, ...) live in **docs** as community-maintained examples against the documented proxy contract (exposed port, health endpoint, `/internal/*` never proxied — see #2193), not as compose profiles Archon maintains: each maintained proxy config doubles a security-critical surface. Cite as `direction.md §deployment-recipes`.
- **Not a package-manager distribution hub.** The maintained install channels are the curl/PowerShell installer, Homebrew, Docker, and the GitHub release binaries. Additional channels (Nix, AUR, Scoop, winget, apt, ...) are welcome as **community-maintained docs recipes**, or as packages upstream in the package manager's own registry (e.g. nixpkgs) where they get that ecosystem's CI and hash-update bots for free — not as in-repo manifests Archon version-bumps. Every hash-pinned channel adds a per-release chore and a surface that rots silently between releases; Homebrew already costs one. Cite as `direction.md §distribution-channels`.
- **Not a programming language.** The workflow YAML coordinates (gates, joins, retries, sessions, artifacts, reusable structure); computation lives inside nodes, not in the YAML. PRs that add computation to the YAML surface conflict — see §workflow-language. This is about the *language*, not about which node type an author picks: a `prompt:` node that computes is a legitimate choice — see §prompt-computation.

## Community providers

Archon ships built-in providers for Claude (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) and Codex (`@openai/codex-sdk`). Pi (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`) is the reference community provider and sets the pattern others should follow.

**Acceptance criteria** for new community providers:

- **Coding-agent SDK only.** The provider must wrap an existing coding-agent SDK — one that handles file edits, tool use, multi-turn sessions, and planning. Raw LLM API integrations (`chat.completions`-style) are out of scope. Pi already covers ~20 LLM backends via one harness, so single-model wrappers duplicate work that is already done.
- **Match the Pi pattern.** Structure mirrors `packages/providers/src/community/pi/` — provider class implementing `IAgentProvider`, options translator, event bridge, capability matrix, registered with `builtIn: false`. Tests at parity with the Pi suite (config, options-translator, event-bridge, provider, session-resolver as the baseline).
- **Docs page.** Add the provider to `packages/docs-web/src/content/docs/getting-started/ai-assistants.md` with setup, capability matrix, and supported config keys.

**Maintenance policy:**

- We accept any provider that meets the criteria above. There is no cap.
- The contributor and the community maintain the provider. Archon maintainers do not own upstream-SDK breaks for community providers.
- A community provider that goes non-functional — CI broken, upstream SDK gone, no maintainer response — is marked deprecated and removed in the next minor release unless someone from the community submits a fix.

When citing this policy in a PR comment: `direction.md §community-providers`.

## Workflow language (YAML surface)

The workflow YAML is a **coordination language**, not a programming language. Admissibility test for any new YAML surface feature (field, node type, expression capability): (1) does the *engine* need to see it to govern the run? (2) is it declarative data, not evaluation? (3) could a script node + existing wiring express it today? A feature that computes rather than coordinates is declined with a pointer to the escape hatch. Full rationale, case law, and the five failure smells: `packages/docs-web/src/content/docs/reference/workflow-language-constitution.md`.

Triage clauses — cite as `direction.md §<clause>`:

- **§when-grammar** — `when:` never grows incrementally (no parentheses, functions, string ops, arithmetic). Standing answer: compute the decision in a `script:` node, gate on `$node.output.field`. Only sanctioned growth is adopting CEL wholesale in one versioned change — never home-grown operators.
- **§load-time-composition** — composition targets and body topology must resolve at load time. The engine may repeat that static body at runtime (for a loop or runtime item list); data may determine repetition, never select a target or construct topology. A dynamically selected target or graph is a sub-run — a governance object with its own run record (#2121 Phase 2, co-designed with #1764) — not a language feature.
- **§governed-launch-ownership** — a `workflow:` node launches an independently governed workflow. The caller may bind declared inputs and choose launch coordination or isolation, but cannot override the child's authored provider, model, reasoning, tools, or capability policy; those remain owned by the child and resolve through normal tier and alias configuration. Authors who need different execution policy should launch an explicitly authored variant rather than mutate the child across the run boundary.
- **§workaround-triage** — repeated YAML structure or *recurring* deterministic logic embedded in prompts is a signal, triaged into three buckets: missing *coordination* primitive → design it constitutionally; missing *pattern* → document the pattern (e.g. polyglot validate = detect-AI → execute-bash → fix-AI); computation that has leaked *into the YAML surface* → point at script nodes. This bucket never produces a rewrite-the-prompt verdict — see §prompt-computation. The workaround corpus decides language shape; the feature-request queue doesn't.
- **§prompt-computation** — the constitution governs the **YAML surface**, not what an agent does inside a node. A `prompt:` node performing computation is a legitimate authoring choice, and the right one when the author doesn't know the rule or expects it to change — forcing an uncertain rule into a script freezes a guess into code. Script vs prompt is ordinary engineering owned by the workflow author. **Never decline or rewrite a prompt on constitutional grounds.** The only sanctioned argument for making a specific check deterministic is *reliability*: no judgment content (one correct answer) plus irreversible external consequences if it doesn't fire — argue that on its merits, not by citing the constitution.
- **§schema-width** — new provider capabilities default into provider config or tier/alias presets, not new node fields; a node field is earned only by genuine per-node variance. Capability mismatches warn loudly, never silently no-op (`capabilities.ts` is the source of truth; docs derive from it — #2116).
- **§implicit-behavior** — a new implicit behavior (auto-anything) must be documented in the canonical behavior list, individually defeatable, and fail-safe — convenience alone never qualifies.

## Open questions (no stance yet)

These are direction calls we haven't made. PRs that touch these areas should surface the question for explicit decision rather than be silently accepted or rejected. The workflow may add to this list as new questions appear.

- **License posture.** Whether Archon stays MIT or moves to a fair-code/source-available license (and adopts a CLA) for a future hosted/enterprise offering is undecided — deferred to the maintainers. PRs that assume either posture are premature.

## How to evolve this doc

- Add a "What Archon IS" or "is NOT" line when a PR triage forces a direction call.
- Move "Open questions" entries to the IS / IS NOT sections once decided.
- Reference the relevant clause in PR comments when declining: `direction.md §single-tenant-per-install`.
- Keep entries short — one or two lines each. The point is fast lookup during triage, not a manifesto.
