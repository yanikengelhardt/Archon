# Parameter Matrix (Quick Reference)

One-page lookup for Archon workflow parameters: which field works on which node type, how to pick the right parameter for a given intent, and the gotchas that don't fail loudly.

This is a **lookup reference**. For the full explanation of any field, follow the cross-references at the bottom to the detailed guides.

## Master Matrix: Parameters × Node Types

There are **eight** node types. Exactly one of `command`, `prompt`, `bash`, `script`, `loop`, `loop_group`, `approval`, or `cancel` must appear per node.

| Parameter                                    | command | prompt  | bash    | script  | loop                         | loop_group                   | approval       | cancel  |

| `loop` (nested config)                       | —       | —       | —       | —       | **required**                 | —                            | —              | —       |

¹ Bash/script nodes retry only with an explicit `retry:` block (no silent default retries for deterministic work). On builds before the #2088 fix, `retry:` on bash/script was accepted but never executed.
² `approval` has no retry — its rework mechanism is `on_reject: {prompt, max_attempts}`, a different thing.

**Reading the matrix:**
- **yes** — field works as expected on this node type.
- **ignored** — field is accepted by the parser but has no effect at runtime. Loader emits a warning (`<node-type>_node_ai_fields_ignored`).
- **hard error** — workflow fails to load. Only `retry` on a loop/loop_group node does this.

Most AI features work on `command` and `prompt` nodes. Loop and loop_group nodes are iteration controllers — but their `model`/`provider` ARE honored (forwarded to iterations / body defaults). A loop_group **body node** is a full node of its own type, so per-node AI fields work normally inside the body. `bash` and `script` nodes ignore AI fields with a warning. `approval` and `cancel` nodes don't invoke AI (except `approval.on_reject.prompt`).

## Silent Failures (what gets ignored without erroring)

Things that don't fail parsing but don't do what you'd expect:

1. **`hooks` / `mcp` / `skills` / `output_format` / `allowed_tools` / `denied_tools` on a loop, loop_group, bash, script, approval, or cancel node** → silently ignored. (NOT `model`/`provider` on loop/loop_group — those work: forwarded per iteration / as body defaults.)
2. **`context: fresh` on a loop / loop_group** → ignored. Use the loop config's `fresh_context: true` instead.
3. **`output_format` on a bash or script node** → schema is accepted but bash/script output is whatever stdout says; no JSON coercion.
4. **Unknown `$nodeId.output` (whole-text) reference at runtime** → resolves to empty string + warning. But `$nodeId.output.field` is STRICT — an unresolvable field (not in the producer's schema, non-JSON schemaless output, missing key, or producer skipped) **fails the consuming node loudly**, it does not resolve empty. And load-time validation rejects refs to node ids that don't exist at all.
5. **Invalid `when:` expression syntax** → node silently skipped (fail-closed). Distinct from the strict field-ref failure above.
6. **`$LOOP_PREV.*` in a body node's `when:`** → NOT substituted (prompt fields only); the condition sees the literal text and fails to parse → node skipped.
7. **`allowed_tools` / `denied_tools` on Codex nodes** → ignored. Use Codex CLI config (`~/.codex/config.toml`).
8. **`hooks` on Codex nodes** → ignored + warning logged.
9. **`mcp` or `skills` per-node on Codex** → ignored. Configure globally in `~/.codex/config.toml` or `~/.agents/skills/`.
10. **`trigger_rule: all_success` after `when:`-gated fan-out** → branches that didn't run count as "not succeeded"; the join node will never fire. Use `none_failed_min_one_success` or `one_success`.
11. **Node-level `interactive: true` on an approval node or loop, without workflow-level `interactive: true`** → on the Web UI, gate messages never reach the user. The workflow dispatches to a background worker that can't deliver chat messages.
12. **Missing env var in MCP config** → warning logged, node continues with empty string substitution.
13. **`retry` on a loop node** → this one is a **hard parse error** (not silent). Use the loop's own `max_iterations` and `until_bash` for finish-line detection.
14. **`String.raw\`$nodeId.output\`` in a `script:` body** → silently corrupts when the substituted value contains a backtick (e.g. markdown code spans in AI output or `output_format` payloads). The template literal terminates early, producing a cryptic `Expected ";"` parse error. Use direct assignment instead: `const data = $nodeId.output;` — JSON is valid JS expression syntax and needs no wrapper.

The pattern across these: if you set an AI feature on a non-AI node, it's silently ignored. Watch loader logs for `_ignored` warnings when debugging.

## Inline `agents:` (Task-tool sub-agents)

A node can define named sub-agents that Claude invokes via the `Task` tool. Useful for map-reduce patterns: one node spawns N parallel sub-tasks with a cheap model, then a reducer summarizes.

```yaml
- id: analysis
  prompt: |
    For each area of the codebase, delegate to the appropriate sub-agent
    via the Task tool. Summarize all findings into a single report.
  agents:
    security-scanner:                     # kebab-case id
      description: "Scan for common web vulnerabilities"
      prompt: "Run OWASP top-10 style checks on the given files"
      model: haiku
      tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]           # tool whitelist for this sub-agent
      disallowedTools: [Write, Edit, Bash]
      maxTurns: 5
    test-coverage-auditor:
      description: "Report untested or weakly-tested surfaces"
      prompt: "Identify code paths without corresponding tests"
      model: haiku
      tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]
      skills: [test-coverage-patterns]    # skill injection per sub-agent
      maxTurns: 5
```

**Fields per agent:**

| Field              | Required | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`      | yes      | Shown when Claude decides which agent to delegate to      |
| `prompt`           | yes      | System prompt the sub-agent runs under                    |
| `model`            | no       | Per-agent model override                                  |
| `tools`            | no       | Tool whitelist for the sub-agent                          |
| `disallowedTools`  | no       | Tool blacklist                                            |
| `skills`           | no       | Skills to inject into the sub-agent                       |
| `maxTurns`         | no       | Max conversation turns for the sub-agent                  |

**Naming rule:** lowercase kebab-case. No leading or trailing hyphens, no double hyphens, no digits-only ids.

**When to use `agents:` vs fan-out at the workflow level:**
- Use `agents:` when the number of sub-tasks is dynamic or decided by the orchestrator node at runtime.
- Use workflow-level fan-out (parallel nodes with `depends_on: [setup]`) when the sub-tasks are known ahead of time and each needs its own artifact.

| `effort` / `thinking`           | yes           | use `modelReasoningEffort` for reasoning models | via `effort:` (maps to thinking level) | no (opencode.json agent config) | yes (maps like Pi) |
| Provider session resume (`persist_session`, `context: shared` threading) | yes | yes            | yes                                  | yes                  | yes                 |

Whatever the enforcement tier, a node with `output_format` either produces schema-valid output or **fails** — validation runs for every provider, and best-effort providers re-ask up to 3 times first. Prefer tier keywords (`model: small|medium|large`) over hardcoded model ids — they resolve per-install from config.

Note: workflow `--resume` (re-run skipping completed nodes) is engine-level and provider-independent — it never restores AI session context. Cross-RUN context restoration is exclusively `persist_session` (row above).

Mixing providers in one workflow: set workflow-level `provider: claude`, then override per-node with `provider: codex` or `provider: pi`. Cross-provider `$nodeId.output` substitution works as expected.

## Ten Principles for Safe Workflow Design

1. Always use `--branch <name>` (or `worktree: {enabled: true}`) for workflows that modify the codebase.
2. Validate before running: `archon validate workflows <name>`.
3. Tier your models — prefer tier keywords: `model: small` for routing and glue, `medium` for reasoning and review, `large` only where the context is deep. Tiers resolve from install config, so the workflow stays portable.
4. Use `output_format` for every node whose output downstream `when:` reads. Never pattern-match free-form AI text.
5. On Ralph-style loops, use `loop.fresh_context: true` and treat `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` as the source of truth. Command bodies should re-read state at the top of every iteration.
6. Use interactive loops for iterative refinement with the human. Use `approval:` nodes for single-point checkpoints.
7. Read-only analysis phases use `denied_tools: [Write, Edit, Bash]`. Separation of concerns.
8. Use `hooks.PostToolUse` to enforce post-change validation (type-check, lint). Tighter feedback loop than end-of-workflow review.
9. Large artifacts go through `$ARTIFACTS_DIR`. Small structured data goes through `$nodeId.output.field`.
10. AI can scaffold a workflow. Only a human can verify it. Read the YAML before running.
