# Mounts the overlayfs — read-only lower bind of the project root
# (/mnt/lower) + writable upper/work on the per-run volume (/mnt/upper) — at the
# host's absolute cwd ($ARCHON_WORKSPACE_PATH), so working_path, $ARTIFACTS_DIR,
# and every path substitution stay unchanged (same-absolute-path invariant).
#
# The mount MODE is dictated by the backend via $ARCHON_OVERLAY_MODE so the
# security posture is explicit per container, not guessed here:
#   - fuse   → fuse-overlayfs (backend ran us with /dev/fuse and NO CAP_SYS_ADMIN;
#              only works where the daemon grants unprivileged FUSE mounts —
#              rootless / userns-remap — otherwise this FAILS FAST and the backend
#              retries in native mode).
#   - native → kernel `mount -t overlay` (backend ran us WITH CAP_SYS_ADMIN +
#              apparmor=unconfined). See SECURITY.md: CAP_SYS_ADMIN lets
#              in-container root remount the /mnt/lower bind read-write, so native
#              mode is isolation-hardening, NOT a sandbox against a hostile agent.
#
# On mount failure we exit 1 immediately (fail fast) so the backend's ready-poll
# sees the container exit and falls back / surfaces the error without waiting out
# the full timeout. All real work arrives later via `docker exec`.
