/**
 * Process-level cache of reloaded, extension-bearing ResourceLoaders (issue #1877).
 *
 * Pi's `DefaultResourceLoader.reload()` re-runs the entire extension-discovery
 * pipeline — `packageManager.resolve()` + `loadExtensions()` — and
 * `loadExtensions()` re-invokes every installed extension's factory from scratch
 * (jiti is created with `moduleCache: false`). Those factories can construct
 * process-scoped singletons (ports, file handles, nested SDK clients) in their
 * setup or `session_start` handler. That state is never torn down between Archon
 * `sendQuery()` calls: Archon disposes sessions via `session.dispose()`, which —
 * unlike `session.reload()` — does NOT emit `session_shutdown`. So the SECOND
 * `reload()` in a process deadlocks colliding with the first call's still-live
 * state, and every Pi workflow node after the first idle-times-out.
 *
 * Fix: reload the extension-bearing loader ONCE per process per loader-affecting
 * input set and reuse it. `createAgentSession({ resourceLoader })` skips its own
 * internal `reload()` when a loader is supplied, and reads the already-loaded
 * extensions via `resourceLoader.getExtensions()` — so reuse is safe. Each
 * session still builds its own ExtensionRunner and fires `session_start` via
 * `bindExtensions()`, preserving per-node behavior.
 *
 * Growth & eviction: entries are keyed by `(cwd, systemPrompt, skillPaths)`, so
 * the cache grows by at most one small loader per distinct worktree/prompt combo
 * the process ever runs with extensions on — bounded in practice by the number of
 * worktrees touched, not by request volume. Eviction is deliberately limited to
 * the failure path (below): size-capped/LRU eviction is NOT safe here because
 * dropping a loader that a long-running workflow is still using would make that
 * workflow's next node cache-miss and `reload()` a second copy of the same
 * extensions while the first is still live — re-introducing the very deadlock
 * this cache prevents. Time/idle-based reclamation belongs with isolation
 * cleanup (a future cross-package hook), not a blind cap here.

 * (e.g. pi-cursor's `cursor/*`) and fail LOOKUP-2 with "Pi model not found".
 *
 * The snapshot is taken right after `reload()` completes, BEFORE any session
 * can drain the queue (`bindCore()` reassigns the array rather than mutating
 * it, so the copy is stable). The provider re-applies it to every per-call
