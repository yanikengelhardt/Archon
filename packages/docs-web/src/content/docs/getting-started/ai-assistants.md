You must configure **at least one** AI assistant. All four can be configured and mixed within workflows.

For a canonical, at-a-glance comparison of which per-node features each provider supports, see the [Provider Capability Matrix](/reference/provider-capabilities/) — it is generated directly from the providers' capability declarations, so it never drifts from runtime behavior. The per-provider sections below add the field-level YAML syntax and caveats.

## Structured output guarantees

When a workflow node sets `output_format`, the guarantee level depends on the provider's tier (exposed as `capabilities.structuredOutput` on `GET /api/providers`):

| Provider | Tier | How it works | On a validation miss |
|----------|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Claude, Codex, OpenCode | **enforced** | The SDK/backend grammar-constrains decoding (`output_config.format` / `outputSchema` / `format:{json_schema}`). | The node **fails** — a refusal or `max_tokens` truncation can still bypass grammar enforcement, so the parsed output is validated post-parse for these too. No reask (a failure here is a genuine edge). |
| Pi, Copilot | **best-effort** | The schema is appended to the prompt; JSON is extracted from the response and structurally repaired (trailing commas, single quotes, truncated tails). | The executor re-asks (prompt + the schema errors) up to **3×**; if still invalid, the node **fails loudly**. |

In all cases the parsed output is **validated against your `output_format` schema** before downstream nodes see it, and a node that declares `output_format` but produces no schema-valid output **fails** rather than silently degrading. See [Authoring Workflows → `output_format`](/guides/authoring-workflows/#output_format-for-structured-json) for field-access (`$node.output.field`) semantics.

## Claude Code

**Recommended for Claude Pro/Max subscribers.**

Archon does not bundle Claude Code. Install it separately, then in compiled Archon binaries, point Archon at the executable. In dev (`bun run`), Archon finds it automatically via `node_modules`.

### Install Claude Code

Anthropic's native installer is the primary recommended install path:

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Alternatives:**

- macOS via Homebrew: `brew install --cask claude-code`
- npm (any platform): `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Windows via winget: `winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode`

See [Anthropic's setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) for the full list and auto-update caveats per install path.

### Binary path configuration (compiled binaries only)

In compiled Archon binaries, if `claude` is not on the default install path Archon autodetects, supply the path via either:

1. **Environment variable** (highest precedence):
   ```ini
   CLAUDE_BIN_PATH=/absolute/path/to/claude
   ```
2. **Config file** (`~/.archon/config.yaml` or a repo-local `.archon/config.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   assistants:
     claude:
       claudeBinaryPath: /absolute/path/to/claude
   ```
3. **Autodetect** (zero-config fallback): Archon probes `~/.local/bin/claude` (POSIX) and `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe` (Windows), matching the native curl/PowerShell installer layouts.

If none of the three resolves in a compiled binary, Archon throws with install instructions on first Claude query.

The Claude Agent SDK accepts the native compiled binary, a JS `cli.js`, or the npm platform-package directory (e.g. `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-win32-x64`) — directories are auto-expanded to the contained `claude`/`claude.exe`.

**Dev mode override:** when running from source (`bun run dev:server`), the SDK auto-resolves its bundled per-platform binary by default. Set `CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` if you need to override that — most commonly on glibc Linux where the SDK picks the musl variant first and fails to spawn. Config-file `claudeBinaryPath` is intentionally binary-mode-only (per-repo, not per-machine).

**Typical paths by install method:**

| Install method | Typical executable path |
|---|---|
| Native curl installer (macOS/Linux) | `~/.local/bin/claude` |
| Native PowerShell installer (Windows) | `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe` |
| Homebrew cask | `$(brew --prefix)/bin/claude` (symlink) |
| npm global install | `$(npm root -g)/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js` |
| npm platform-package directory (Windows) | `$(npm root -g)/@anthropic-ai/claude-code-win32-x64` — directory accepted, auto-expanded to `claude.exe` |
| Windows winget | Resolvable via `where claude` |
| Docker (`ghcr.io/coleam00/archon`) | Pre-set via `ENV CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` in the image — no action required |

If in doubt, `which claude` (macOS/Linux) or `where claude` (Windows) will resolve the executable on your PATH after any of the installers above.

### Authentication Options

Claude Code supports three authentication modes via `CLAUDE_USE_GLOBAL_AUTH`:

1. **Global Auth** (set to `true`): Uses credentials from `claude /login`
2. **Explicit Tokens** (set to `false`): Uses tokens from env vars below
3. **Auto-Detect** (not set): Uses tokens if present in env, otherwise global auth

If both `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `CLAUDE_API_KEY` are set, the OAuth token wins and no API key is passed to Claude. A per-user credential connected in Settings → Agents always takes precedence over these install-wide variables for that user's runs.

### Option 1: Global Auth (Recommended)

```ini
CLAUDE_USE_GLOBAL_AUTH=true
```

### Option 2: OAuth Token

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI first: https://docs.claude.com/claude-code/installation
claude setup-token

# Copy the token starting with sk-ant-oat01-...
```

```ini
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-xxxxx
```

### Option 3: API Key (Pay-per-use)

1. Visit [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Create a new key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

```ini
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

### Claude Configuration Options

You can configure Claude's behavior in `.archon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  claude:
    model: sonnet  # or 'opus', 'haiku', 'claude-*', 'inherit'
    settingSources:
      - project      # Default: only project-level CLAUDE.md
      - user         # Optional: also load ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
    # Optional: absolute path to the Claude Code executable.
    # Required in compiled Archon binaries if CLAUDE_BIN_PATH is not set.
    # claudeBinaryPath: /absolute/path/to/claude
```

The `settingSources` option controls where the Claude Code SDK discovers `CLAUDE.md`, skill, command, and agent files. The default is `['project', 'user']`, which includes both the project-level `<cwd>/.claude/` and your personal `~/.claude/`. For workflow skills, discovery is only eligibility: the node's `skills:` list remains the exact active selection, and omission/`[]` activates none. Set `settingSources` to `['project']` to exclude user-level resources, or `[]` for a lean node with no setting sources; a declared skill must live under a source the node enables. See [Claude SDK Advanced Options](/guides/authoring-workflows/#claude-sdk-advanced-options).

### Set as Default (Optional)

If you want Claude to be the default AI assistant for new conversations without codebase context, set this environment variable:

```ini
DEFAULT_AI_ASSISTANT=claude
```

## Codex

Archon does not bundle the Codex CLI. Install it, then authenticate.

### Install the Codex CLI

```bash
# Any platform (primary method):
npm install -g @openai/codex

# macOS alternative:
brew install codex

# Windows: npm install works but is experimental.
# OpenAI recommends WSL2 for the best experience.
```

Native prebuilt binaries (`.dmg`, `.tar.gz`, `.exe`) are also published on the [Codex releases page](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases) for users who prefer a direct binary — drop one in `~/.archon/vendor/codex/codex` (or `codex.exe` on Windows) and Archon will find it automatically in compiled binary mode.

See [OpenAI's Codex CLI docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) for the full install matrix.

### Binary path configuration (compiled binaries only)

In compiled Archon binaries, if `codex` is not on the default PATH Archon expects, supply the path via either:

1. **Environment variable** (highest precedence):
   ```ini
   CODEX_BIN_PATH=/absolute/path/to/codex
   ```
2. **Config file** (`~/.archon/config.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   assistants:
     codex:
       codexBinaryPath: /absolute/path/to/codex
   ```
3. **Vendor directory** (zero-config fallback): drop the native binary at `~/.archon/vendor/codex/codex` (or `codex.exe` on Windows).
4. **Autodetect** (zero-config fallback): if the vendor directory is empty, Archon probes the common npm-global install layouts: `~/.npm-global/bin/codex` (POSIX), `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex` (macOS Apple Silicon), `/usr/local/bin/codex` (macOS Intel and Linux), `%APPDATA%\npm\codex.cmd` and `%USERPROFILE%\.npm-global\codex.cmd` (Windows). For other npm prefixes or custom layouts, set `CODEX_BIN_PATH` or the config path explicitly.

Dev mode (`bun run`) does not require any of the above — the SDK resolves `codex` via `node_modules`.

### Authenticate

```bash
codex login

# Follow browser authentication flow
```

### Extract Credentials from Auth File

On Linux/Mac:
```bash
cat ~/.codex/auth.json
```

On Windows:
```cmd
type %USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json
```

### Set Environment Variables

Set all four environment variables in your `.env`:

```ini
CODEX_ID_TOKEN=eyJhbGc...
CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJhbGc...
CODEX_REFRESH_TOKEN=rt_...
CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID=6a6a7ba6-...
```

### Codex Configuration Options

You can configure Codex's behavior in `.archon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  codex:
    model: gpt-5.6-sol
    modelReasoningEffort: medium  # 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh'
                                  # (install default; a workflow's `effort:` overrides it)
    webSearchMode: live           # 'disabled' | 'cached' | 'live'
    additionalDirectories:
      - /absolute/path/to/other/repo
```

### Set as Default (Optional)

If you want Codex to be the default AI assistant for new conversations without codebase context, set this environment variable:

```ini
DEFAULT_AI_ASSISTANT=codex
```

### Skills

Codex supports installed skills from `.agents/skills/`. In workflow nodes Archon
turns the automatic skill catalog off, so commands and prompts invoke a skill
explicitly with `$skill-name`. Direct Codex chat keeps native discovery behavior.
Run `archon skill install` (or `archon setup`) to install the bundled `archon`
and `manage-run` skills for both Claude Code and Codex.

See [Per-Node Skills](/guides/skills/#codex-compatibility) for behavior details and limitations.

## OpenCode (Community Provider)

**SDK-backed community provider.** Archon's OpenCode adapter uses `@opencode-ai/sdk`, which provides a multi-provider AI coding agent with support for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more through a unified interface.

OpenCode is registered as `builtIn: false` — like Pi, it is a bundled community provider rather than a core built-in.

Archon always runs OpenCode as a **managed embedded runtime** — it spawns and owns the OpenCode server process, generates a random server password per session, and tears it down when the workflow completes. Connecting to an external OpenCode server (`baseUrl`) is not supported.

### Install

OpenCode is included as a dependency of `@archon/providers` — `bun install` pulls in the SDK automatically. It's available immediately.

### Authenticate

OpenCode handles authentication internally — Archon does not pass API keys through config. Configure credentials using one of these methods:

1. **`/connect` TUI command** — Run `opencode` in your terminal, then use the `/connect` command to interactively authenticate with your chosen provider
2. **Config file** — Store credentials in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` with `{env:VAR}` or `{file:PATH}` substitution
3. **Auth file** — Credentials are persisted in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` after connecting

OpenCode delegates to the underlying LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) based on your model selection. Request-scoped env vars from Archon workflows are still merged into the OpenCode environment.

### Configuration Options

```yaml
assistants:
  opencode:
    model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet  # Required: '<provider>/<model>' format
    # or build-in agent
    agent: general
```

### Model reference format

OpenCode models use a `<provider>/<model>` format. List all available models via `opencode models`:

```yaml
assistants:
  opencode:
    model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet   # via Anthropic
    # model: openai/gpt-4o                # via OpenAI
    # model: google/gemini-2.5-pro        # via Google
```

### Supported Archon Features

| Feature | Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Session resume | ✅ | Single-agent runs return `sessionId`; multi-agent runs do not |
| MCP servers | ✅ | `mcp: path/to/servers.json` passed through to OpenCode |
| Structured output | ✅ | `output_format:` — schema passed to OpenCode SDK |
| System prompt override | ✅ | `systemPrompt:` |
| Codebase env vars (`envInjection`) | ✅ | merged into the spawned OpenCode environment |
| Skills | ✅ | SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter, pattern-based permissions |
| Tool restrictions | ✅ | `tools` / `disallowedTools` per agent; deny wins over allow |
| Inline agents (`agents:`) | ✅ | File-materialized agents; single and parallel multi-agent fan-out |
| Hooks | ❌ | Archon's per-node `hooks` field is Claude-SDK-shaped; the OpenCode provider has no translation site, so a node's `hooks:` is ignored (with a warning) |
| Effort / reasoning control | ❌ | No per-request param; not configurable in agent file, opencode puts it in config. |
| Thinking control | ❌ | No explicit `thinking` field in agent frontmatter; OpenCode auto-enables reasoning when `agents[].model` is a reasoning-capable model (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`) |
| Fallback model | ❌ | No native failover in the SDK |
| Sandbox | ❌ | Not native in the SDK; Archon uses worktree isolation |
| Cost limits (`maxBudgetUsd`) | ❌ | Cost tracked in result chunks, but no runtime budget enforcement |

Unsupported YAML fields trigger a visible warning from the dag-executor when the workflow runs, so you always know what was ignored.

### Usage in workflows

```yaml
name: my-workflow
provider: opencode
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet

nodes:
  - id: analyze
    prompt: "Analyze the codebase structure"
    # per-node model override:
    # model: openai/gpt-4o
```

## Pi (Community Provider)

**One adapter, ~20 LLM backends.** Pi (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) is a community-maintained coding-agent harness that Archon integrates as the first community provider. It unlocks Anthropic, OpenAI, Google (Gemini + Vertex), Groq, Mistral, Cerebras, xAI, OpenRouter, Hugging Face, and local inference (LM Studio, ollama, llamacpp, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints registered in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`) under a single `provider: pi` entry.

Pi is registered as `builtIn: false` — it validates the community-provider seam rather than being a core-team-maintained option. If it proves stable and valuable it may be promoted to `builtIn: true` later.

### Install

Pi is included as a dependency of `@archon/providers` — no separate install needed. It's available immediately.

### Quick setup via wizard

Run `archon setup` and select **Pi (community)** in the AI assistant multiselect. The wizard prompts for your preferred backend and API key, writes the key to `~/.archon/.env`, and writes the model ref to `~/.archon/config.yaml` automatically.

### Authenticate

Pi supports both OAuth subscriptions and API keys. Archon's adapter reads your existing Pi credentials from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (written by running `pi` → `/login`) AND from env vars — env vars take priority per-request so codebase-scoped overrides work.

**OAuth subscriptions (run `pi /login` locally):**
- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro
- GitHub Copilot
- Google Gemini CLI
- Google Antigravity

**API keys (env vars):**

| Pi provider id | Env var |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` (subscription, read first) or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `google` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `groq` | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| `mistral` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| `cerebras` | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` |
| `xai` | `XAI_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `huggingface` | `HF_TOKEN` |

The full backend → env-var map is generated from the installed Pi SDK (`bun run generate:pi-vendor-map`) and covers every key-based backend (DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, Azure OpenAI, Vercel AI Gateway, Cloudflare, MiniMax, Moonshot, Z.AI, Xiaomi, …). Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex authenticate via ambient cloud credentials (AWS chain / gcloud ADC) instead of a pasted key.

**Local / custom providers (no credentials needed):**

Providers that aren't in the env-var table above (LM Studio, ollama, llamacpp, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints) work without any Archon-side configuration. Register them in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` per Pi's own docs and reference them as `<pi-provider-id>/<model-id>`:

```yaml
# .archon/config.yaml
assistants:
  pi:
    model: lm-studio/qwen2.5-coder-14b   # whatever ID you registered with Pi
```

Archon logs an info-level `pi.auth_missing` event when no credentials are found and continues — Pi's SDK then connects directly to the local endpoint defined in `models.json`. If the provider does require auth (a less-common cloud backend not in the env-var table) the SDK call fails downstream; the `pi.auth_missing` breadcrumb in the log lets you trace it back to a missing env-var mapping.

### Pi settings (baseline behavior)

Archon reads your Pi settings files as the starting point for every session:

- **`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`** — global Pi preferences (retry counts, transport, compaction strategy, thinking budgets, default model, etc.)
- **`<repo>/.pi/settings.json`** — project-level overrides on top of global

All settings flow in automatically. You do not need to re-state them in Archon's `config.yaml`. To configure baseline Pi settings, edit `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` directly.

Archon never writes back to these files — `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` is read-only from Archon's perspective. Session-level changes (model switches, thinking-level adjustments) are held in memory only and discarded when the session ends, matching Claude and Codex behavior.

If Pi settings files do not exist (Docker, first-time setup, compiled binary with no Pi home directory), Archon falls back to Pi SDK defaults. Parse errors in the settings files are logged as warnings (`pi.settings_load_error`) and never prevent the session from starting.

### Extensions (on by default)

A major reason to pick Pi is its **extension ecosystem**: community packages (installed via `pi install npm:<package>`) and your own local ones that hook into the agent's lifecycle. Extensions can intercept tool calls, gate execution on human review, post to external systems, render UIs — anything the Pi extension API exposes.

Archon turns extensions **on by default**. To opt out in `.archon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  pi:
    enableExtensions: false   # skip extension discovery entirely
    # interactive: false       # keep extensions loaded, but give them no UI bridge
```

Most extensions need three config surfaces:

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `extensionFlags` | Per-extension feature flags (maps 1:1 to Pi's `--flag` CLI switches) |
| `env` | Env vars the extension reads at runtime (managed via `.archon/config.yaml` or the Web UI codebase env panel) |
| `interactive: true` | Binds a UI context so approval-gate extensions can block for human input; also set the **workflow-level** `interactive: true` on the web UI so the run stays foreground |

#### Scoping extension posture per node

`enableExtensions`, `interactive`, and `extensionFlags` are the three fields that make up a node's **extension posture**. Setting them under `assistants.pi` applies the posture to *every* Pi node in *every* workflow — which is usually wrong. A planning extension like plannotator only belongs on the node that actually plans: if the same `plan: true` flag leaks into a downstream `implement` node, that node starts in planning mode, its code edits get blocked ("edits are limited to markdown files"), and it hangs waiting on a review nobody asked for.

Scope the posture to the node that plays that role. Three layers resolve per node, in ascending precedence:

1. **Assistant-level** (`assistants.pi.*`) — the install-wide default for every Pi node.
2. **Install-level node map** (`assistants.pi.nodes.<nodeId>`) — overrides the default for a node id on this machine. Handy when you can't edit the workflow, but it's non-portable: the override lives in one machine's `config.yaml` and is keyed by node-id string, so a node rename silently orphans it.
3. **Portable node `pi:` block** — the per-node posture written directly in the workflow YAML. It travels with the workflow and wins over both layers above. This is the recommended surface.

Each layer's `extensionFlags` shallow-merge over the ones below it (later wins per key), so a node can negate an inherited flag with `plan: false`. The `pi:` block is honored on `prompt`, `command`, and `loop` nodes (a `loop:` node's per-iteration call is exactly where planning mode tends to leak); on a `loop_group` it's ignored with a warning — put it on the body nodes instead.

**Example — [plannotator](https://github.com/dmcglinn/plannotator) (human-in-the-loop plan review):**

```bash
# One-time install into your Pi home
pi install npm:@plannotator/pi-extension
```

Keep `assistants.pi` free of the planning flag — set only the extension's runtime env there:

```yaml
# .archon/config.yaml
assistants:
  pi:
    model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
    env:
      PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE: "1" # exposes the review URL on 127.0.0.1:19432 so you can open it from anywhere
```

Then grant the `plan` flag and a UI context to the planner node, and explicitly deny them on the implement loop — right in the workflow, so the posture ships with it:

```yaml
# .archon/workflows/plan-then-build.yaml
name: plan-then-build
provider: pi
interactive: true             # workflow-level: keeps the run foreground on the web UI so you can approve
nodes:
  - id: plan
    prompt: "Draft a plan for: $ARGUMENTS"
    pi:
      interactive: true        # bind the UI context — plannotator opens its review server
      extensionFlags:
        plan: true             # planning mode ON for this node only

  - id: implement
    depends_on: [plan]
    loop:
      prompt: "Implement the approved plan. Print DONE when finished."
      until: "DONE"
      max_iterations: 10
    pi:
      interactive: false       # no review server on the implement loop
      extensionFlags:
        plan: false            # planning mode OFF — code edits are allowed
```

When the `plan` node runs, plannotator prints a review URL and blocks until you click approve/deny in the browser. Archon's CLI/SSE batch buffer flushes that URL to you immediately so you never get stuck waiting on a node that silently wants input. The `implement` loop then runs headless with edits allowed.

If you can't edit the workflow (e.g. a bundled default), the same scoping is available install-side via the node map — same precedence, lower priority than the workflow's own `pi:` block:

```yaml
# .archon/config.yaml
assistants:
  pi:
    nodes:
      plan:
        interactive: true
        extensionFlags: { plan: true }
      implement:
        interactive: false
        extensionFlags: { plan: false }
```

### Model reference format

Pi models use a `<pi-provider-id>/<model-id>` format:

```yaml
assistants:
  pi:
    model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5       # via Anthropic
    # model: google/gemini-2.5-pro           # via Google
    # model: groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile   # via Groq
    # model: openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder    # via OpenRouter (nested slashes allowed)
```

### Usage in workflows

```yaml
name: my-workflow
provider: pi
model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5

nodes:
  - id: fast-node
    provider: pi
    model: groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile   # per-node override — switches backends
    prompt: "..."
    effort: low
    allowed_tools: [read, grep]            # Pi's built-in tools: read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls

  - id: careful-node
    provider: pi
    model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
    prompt: "..."
    effort: high
    skills: [archon-dev]                   # Archon name refs work — see Pi capabilities below
```

### Pi capabilities

| Feature | Support | YAML field |
|---|---|---|
| Extensions (community + local) | ✅ (default on) | `enableExtensions: false` to disable; `interactive: false` to load without UI bridge; `extensionFlags: { <name>: true }` per extension. Scope per node with a `pi:` block (`pi: { interactive, enableExtensions, extensionFlags }`) — see [Scoping extension posture per node](#scoping-extension-posture-per-node) |
| Session resume | ✅ | automatic (Archon persists `sessionId`) |
| Tool restrictions | ✅ | `allowed_tools` / `denied_tools` (read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls) |
| Thinking level | ✅ | `effort: minimal\|low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max` (every rung is Pi-native; nothing is clamped) |
| Skills | ✅ | `skills: [name]` (searches `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`, user-global) |
| Inline sub-agents | ❌ | `agents:` is Claude-only; ignored with a warning on Pi |
| System prompt override | ✅ | `systemPrompt:` |
| Codebase env vars (`envInjection`) | ✅ | `.archon/config.yaml` `env:` section |
| MCP servers | ❌ | Pi rejects MCP by design |
| In-process native tools | ✅ | none — Archon's `manage_run` tool is auto-injected in project-scoped chat via Pi `customTools` (distinct from MCP, which Pi rejects). Gated on the `nativeTools` provider capability. |
| Claude-SDK hooks | ❌ | Claude-specific format |
| Structured output | ✅ (best-effort) | `output_format:` — schema is appended to the prompt and JSON is parsed out of the assistant text. Handles bare JSON, ```json```-fenced, reasoning-model prose preambles like `Let me evaluate... {...}` (Minimax M2.x pattern), and structurally-corrupt JSON (trailing commas, single quotes, truncated tails) via repair. The parsed output is then **validated against the schema**; on a miss the executor re-asks (prompt + the schema errors) up to **3×**, and only then **fails** the node (it no longer degrades silently to a warning). Not SDK-enforced like Claude/Codex. |
| Cost limits (`maxBudgetUsd`) | ❌ | tracked in result chunk, not enforced |
| Fallback model | ❌ | not native in Pi |
| Sandbox | ❌ | not native in Pi |

Unsupported YAML fields trigger a visible warning from the dag-executor when the workflow runs, so you always know what was ignored.

## GitHub Copilot (Community Provider)

**Use a GitHub Copilot subscription inside Archon workflows.** Drives the Copilot CLI via `@github/copilot-sdk`, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic via BYOK, Gemini, and the other models Copilot exposes — switch between them with the `model` field.

Copilot is registered as `builtIn: false` — like Pi, a bundled community provider rather than a core built-in.

### Install

For source installs (`bun run`), the SDK + its bundled CLI dependency come along with `bun install` — nothing extra to do.

For compiled Archon binaries, install the Copilot CLI yourself and point Archon at it:

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

Then tell Archon where the binary lives (the resolver searches these in order):

```ini
# .env
COPILOT_BIN_PATH=/absolute/path/to/copilot
```

```yaml
# .archon/config.yaml
assistants:
  copilot:
    copilotCliPath: /absolute/path/to/copilot
```

Or place the binary at `~/.archon/vendor/copilot/copilot` (POSIX) / `~/.archon/vendor/copilot/copilot.exe` (Windows) and the resolver picks it up automatically.

### Authenticate

By default, Copilot uses the credentials from your local `copilot login`. Generic `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` env vars are **not** picked up automatically — classic GitHub PATs lack Copilot entitlement and would fail with a misleading SDK error. Auth precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`** (env) — always wins when set; treated as explicit Copilot intent
2. **`useLoggedInUser: false`** in `.archon/config.yaml` — opts into env-token auth, including generic `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. **`copilot login` credentials** — the default

An active GitHub Copilot subscription is required for any of these to work.

### Copilot Configuration Options

You can configure Copilot's behavior in `.archon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  copilot:
    model: gpt-5-mini             # 'gpt-5', 'gpt-5-mini', 'claude-sonnet-4.5', 'auto', etc.
    modelReasoningEffort: medium  # 'minimal'..'max' — clamped to the SDK's 'low'..'xhigh'
    # configDir: /absolute/path/to/copilot-config
    # enableConfigDiscovery: false  # only enable for trusted repos — bypasses Archon's workflow MCP/skill validation
    # useLoggedInUser: false        # opt into env-token auth (GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN); default uses `copilot login`
    # logLevel: error               # 'none' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'debug' | 'all'
```

Copilot accepts OpenAI models (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`), Anthropic via BYOK (`claude-sonnet-4.5`), Gemini, and more. When no model is configured, Archon passes `model: 'auto'` and Copilot picks.

### Supported Archon Features

| Feature | Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Session resume | ✅ | Returns `sessionId`; reused on resume |
| Reasoning control | ✅ | `effort:` / string `thinking:` → Copilot `reasoningEffort`; `max` maps to SDK `xhigh` |
| System prompt override | ✅ | `systemPrompt:` |
| Codebase env vars | ✅ | merged into the spawned Copilot CLI environment |
| Tool restrictions | ✅ | `allowed_tools` → `availableTools`, `denied_tools` → `excludedTools` |
| MCP servers | ✅ | `mcp: path/to/servers.json` → `SessionConfig.mcpServers` (env vars `$FOO` expanded; missing vars warned) |
| Skills | ✅ | `skills: [name]` resolved from `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` (project or home) → `SessionConfig.skillDirectories` |
| Structured output | ✅ | best-effort via prompt augmentation + repair; the parsed output is validated against the schema, the executor re-asks up to 3× on a miss, then **fails** the node (no longer a silent warning) |
| Sub-agents (`agents:`) | ✅ | `name`/`description`/`prompt`/`tools` → `SessionConfig.customAgents`; Claude-specific fields (`model`, `disallowedTools`, `skills`, `maxTurns`) warn per agent and are ignored |
| Fork-session retry | ⚠️ | Copilot SDK has no fork API — when Archon requests a fork (on retry), we create a fresh session and emit a system-chunk warning |
| Hooks | ❌ | Archon hooks ≠ Copilot's `SessionHooks` event vocabulary |
| Fallback model | ❌ | not wired |
| Cost control | ❌ | no cost-limit API |
| Sandbox | ❌ | Copilot permissions surface is separate from Archon's sandbox model |

### Set as Default (Optional)

```ini
DEFAULT_AI_ASSISTANT=copilot
```

## Per-user credentials and AI Settings

Everything above configures the **install-wide** assistant credentials (env vars, `claude /login`, etc.) — every run uses the same shared keys. On a **shared Archon box** where several people use the same server, each user can instead connect **their own** provider — by API key or subscription — so their runs and chats bill to them, not to the install's shared key.

### When you need this

- You run Archon for a team and want each person to bring their own provider key or Claude Pro/Max / Copilot subscription.
- You want a personal key isolated from the shared install key.

Solo users don't need any of this — the install-wide setup above is enough.

### Enabling it

The credential vault is available on every install — Archon auto-provisions a local key at
`~/.archon/credential-key` on first use. **No setup required for a solo install.**

If you're running a managed or multi-user deploy and want to control the encryption key yourself
(e.g. to rotate it, share it across containers, or keep it in a secrets manager), set
`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the local key file is skipped entirely:

```ini
# .env — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-char hex>
```

> **Rotating `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (or deleting `~/.archon/credential-key`) invalidates all
> stored user credentials — everyone must reconnect. `archon doctor` will report a
> `mass_decrypt_failure` and include a re-connect hint if this happens.

### Connecting from the console

The console **AI Settings** page (Settings in the web UI) has four sections:

- **Model Tiers** — map the `small` / `medium` / `large` tiers to a provider + model (and optional effort). This writes the install's `tiers:` config and works on **any** install, even without `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (it's non-secret config). Pi tier models show a cost/reasoning/context hint from Pi's model catalog.
- **Model Aliases** — define `@custom` refs (e.g. `@fast`) usable in workflow `model:` fields, with the same scope toggle.
- **Agents** — one card per agent (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, Copilot) with the credentials it can spend nested inside, each card showing a readiness state (ready / needs credential). Connect a credential for *your* user inside the agent that uses it. Credentials are keyed by **vendor** (`anthropic`, `openai`, `github-copilot`, `openrouter`, …), and one credential serves every agent that consumes it (an `anthropic` key powers Claude Code and Pi's anthropic backend — both cards reflect it). Every vendor accepts an **API key**; **`anthropic`**, **`openai`**, and **`github-copilot`** additionally offer **subscription login** (an OAuth flow — for `openai`/ChatGPT it is an Archon-owned PKCE flow where you paste the redirect URL or code back, [#1924](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon/issues/1924)). Legacy ids (`claude`/`codex`/`copilot`) are accepted and normalized. The **Pi** card keeps its 30+ backends behind a searchable "Add backend…" picker (with model counts from Pi's catalog) and shows ambient chains (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex) as status-only rows; the **OpenCode** card loads its backend catalog on demand from the embedded runtime — its connections are install-wide, not per-user.
- **Defaults** — leads with a "Chat runs on [provider][model]" combo line in both scopes (the install line edits the default assistant + `assistants.<provider>.model`; the just-me line edits your personal default assistant + chat-model pin), with the per-provider model grid below as the advanced view.

### Per-user model preferences ("Just me")

When you're logged in (a web identity resolves), the **Model Tiers** and **Model Aliases** panels show a **"This install / Just me"** scope toggle, and **Defaults** gains a just-me "Chat runs on" combo (provider + model). The "Just me" scope stores your personal tiers/aliases/default assistant (and optional chat-model pin) in Archon's database and applies them as the **highest-precedence** layer — your overrides win over the install config for runs and chats *you* start, without changing anyone else's. This needs an identity but **no** `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (model names aren't secrets); on a solo install without web auth the toggle simply doesn't appear and everything behaves exactly as before.

If a chat asks for the `large` tier and only a different tier is configured, Archon uses the nearest preset and posts a one-line notice telling you which tier answered and where to set `large`.

### Connecting from the CLI

The same actions are available headless via [`archon ai`](/reference/cli/#ai):

```bash
# Per-user credentials (need TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
echo "$MY_KEY" | archon ai key set openrouter   # API key for any vendor
archon ai login anthropic                        # subscription (anthropic, openai, or github-copilot)
archon ai list                                   # what's connected

# Model tiers + aliases + default (ungated config — solo-OK)
archon ai tier set large claude opus
archon ai alias set @fast claude haiku
archon ai default claude

# The same, but just for YOU (per-user prefs; identity from ARCHON_USER_ID/$USER)
archon ai tier set large claude opus --scope user
archon ai default codex --scope user

# Pin YOUR chat to a specific provider + model without touching the `large`
# tier that workflows use (provider + model are written together; omitting
# the model clears a previous pin)
archon ai default pi openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2 --scope user
```

**How the chat model is resolved.** The provider comes from your personal default (if set), else the conversation's recorded assistant, else the install default. The model then resolves as: your `default_model` pin (only when your default provider matches the effective provider) → the configured `large` tier (yours > repo > global) → the install's `assistants.<provider>.model` (only when no `large` tier is configured anywhere) → the built-in tier default. Workflow nodes are unaffected — `model: large` keeps meaning the tier.

The model-tier presets are the same ones you can hand-write in `~/.archon/config.yaml`; see [Configuration](/reference/configuration/) for the YAML format.

## How Assistant Selection Works

- Assistant type is set per codebase via the `assistant` field in `.archon/config.yaml` or the `DEFAULT_AI_ASSISTANT` env var
- Once a conversation starts, the assistant type is locked for that conversation
- `DEFAULT_AI_ASSISTANT` (optional) is used only for new conversations without codebase context
- Workflows can override the assistant on a per-node basis with `provider` and `model` fields
- Configuration priority: workflow-level options > config file defaults > SDK defaults
