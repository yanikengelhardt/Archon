## Quick Install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archon.diy/install | bash
```

> **x64 compatibility:** Compiled x64 binaries require AVX2. Older Intel/AMD
> hardware and virtual machines that mask AVX2 cannot use the x64 quick install;
> use [From Source](#from-source) instead. ARM64 quick installs are unaffected.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://archon.diy/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install coleam00/archon/archon
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" ghcr.io/coleam00/archon:latest workflow list
```

## Using Archon from a GUI or service

The quick installer and Homebrew install a native, compiled `archon` executable;
they do not require Bun at runtime. A GUI app, `launchd` job, or other process
without your login-shell `PATH` should launch that executable by an absolute path,
configured by the user (the quick-installer defaults are
`/usr/local/bin/archon` on macOS/Linux and
`%USERPROFILE%\\.archon\\bin\\archon.exe` on Windows). Do not invoke the
Bun-linked/source CLI from these processes.

The source-install and `bun link` workflow is for terminal development and
requires Bun on `PATH`.

## From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/Archon
cd Archon
bun install
```

### Prerequisites (Source Install)

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.0.0
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (`claude`)

## Claude Code is required

Archon orchestrates Claude Code; it does not bundle it. Install Claude Code separately:

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL (Anthropic's recommended installer)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Source installs (`bun run`) find the executable automatically via `node_modules`. Compiled binaries (quick install, Homebrew) must point at the Claude Code executable:

```bash
# After the native installer:
export CLAUDE_BIN_PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/claude"

# After `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`:
export CLAUDE_BIN_PATH="$(npm root -g)/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js"
```

Or set it durably in `~/.archon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  claude:
    claudeBinaryPath: /absolute/path/to/claude
```

Docker images (`ghcr.io/coleam00/archon`) ship with Claude Code pre-installed and
`CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` pre-set — no configuration needed.

See [AI Assistants → Claude Code](/getting-started/ai-assistants/#binary-path-configuration-compiled-binaries-only)
for full details and install-layout paths.

## Verify Installation

archon version
```
