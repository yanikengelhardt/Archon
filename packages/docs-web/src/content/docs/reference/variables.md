Archon substitutes variables in command files, inline prompts, bash scripts, and `script:` node bodies before execution. There are three categories of variables: workflow variables (substituted by the workflow engine), positional arguments (substituted by the command handler), and node output references (DAG workflows only).

## Workflow Variables

These variables are substituted by the workflow executor in all node types (`command:`, `prompt:`, `bash:`, `script:`, `loop:`).

| Variable | Resolves to | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` | The user's input message that triggered the workflow | Primary way to pass user input to commands |
| `$USER_MESSAGE` | Same as `$ARGUMENTS` | Alias |
| `$WORKFLOW_ID` | Unique ID for the current workflow run | Useful for artifact naming and log correlation |
| `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` | Pre-created external artifacts directory (`~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/artifacts/runs/<id>/`) | Always exists before node execution; stored outside the repo to avoid polluting the working tree |
| `$BASE_BRANCH` | Base branch for git operations | Resolved in order: `worktree.baseBranch` in `.archon/config.yaml`, then the registered codebase's stored default branch, then git auto-detection. Throws an error if referenced in a prompt but cannot be resolved |
| `$DOCS_DIR` | Documentation directory path | Configured via `docs.path` in `.archon/config.yaml`. Defaults to `docs/` when not set. Never throws |
| `$CONTEXT` | GitHub issue or PR context, if available | Populated when the workflow is triggered from a GitHub issue/PR. Replaced with empty string when unavailable |
| `$EXTERNAL_CONTEXT` | Same as `$CONTEXT` | Alias |
| `$ISSUE_CONTEXT` | Same as `$CONTEXT` | Alias |
| `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` | User feedback from an interactive loop approval gate | Only populated on the first iteration of a resumed interactive loop. Empty string on all other iterations |
| `$REJECTION_REASON` | Reviewer feedback from an approval node rejection | Only available in `on_reject` prompts. Empty string elsewhere |
| `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` | Cleaned output of the previous loop iteration (loop nodes only) | Empty string on the first iteration. Useful for `fresh_context: true` loops that need to reference the prior pass without carrying the full session history |
| `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output` | A body node's output from the previous iteration (loop_group body nodes only) | Empty string on iteration 1. `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output.<field>` accesses structured-output fields with the same strict semantics as `$nodeId.output.field`. See [Cross-Node Loops](/guides/loop-nodes/#cross-node-loops-with-loop_group) |

### Context Variable Behavior

The three context aliases (`$CONTEXT`, `$EXTERNAL_CONTEXT`, `$ISSUE_CONTEXT`) all resolve to the same value. When no issue context is available, they are replaced with an empty string to avoid sending the literal `$CONTEXT` text to the AI.

If issue context is present but no context variable appears in the prompt, the context is **appended** to the end of the prompt automatically. This prevents duplicate context when a command explicitly uses `$CONTEXT`.

### `$BASE_BRANCH` Fail-Fast

Unlike other variables, `$BASE_BRANCH` will cause the workflow to **fail immediately** if:
- The variable is referenced in a prompt, AND
- `worktree.baseBranch` is not set in `.archon/config.yaml`, AND
- The registered codebase has no stored default branch, AND
- Auto-detection from git fails

If the variable is not referenced, no error occurs even if the base branch cannot be determined.

## Positional Arguments

These variables are substituted by the command handler when commands are invoked directly (outside workflows). They are processed before workflow variables.

| Variable | Resolves to | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `$1` | First positional argument | Split by whitespace from the user's input |
| `$2` | Second positional argument | |
| `$3` ... `$9` | Third through ninth positional arguments | |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments as a single string | Same variable, available in both contexts |
| `\$` | Literal `$` character | Escape a dollar sign to prevent substitution |

## Node Output References

In DAG workflows, nodes can reference the output of any completed upstream node. These are substituted after workflow variables.

| Pattern | Resolves to | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `$nodeId.output` | Full output string of the referenced node | The node must be a declared dependency (in `depends_on`) |
| `$nodeId.output.field` | A specific JSON field from the node's output | Requires the upstream node to use `output_format` for structured JSON |

### Shell Quoting in `bash:` vs `script:`

`$nodeId.output` values are **auto shell-quoted** when substituted into `bash:` scripts, so the value is always safe to embed in a shell command. For small outputs, values are single-quoted inline. For outputs exceeding 32 KB, Archon spills to a temp file and substitutes `$(cat '/tmp/path')` instead — the unquoted assignment form is correct in both cases. They are **not** shell-quoted when substituted into `script:` bodies — the raw value is embedded as-is. For script nodes, treat substituted values as untrusted input and parse them with language features (e.g. `JSON.parse`), not by interpolating into shell syntax.

Because `bash:` substitutions arrive pre-quoted, wrapping them in double quotes is a silent footgun for small (inline) values:

```bash
# WRONG — for a small value, $emit.output.status is injected as 'ok' (single-quoted),
# so status="$emit.output.status" becomes status="'ok'" — the quotes become data.
status="$emit.output.status"
[ "$status" = "ok" ] && echo pass   # → silently fails ($status is 'ok', not ok)

# CORRECT — leave the substitution unquoted; Archon's quoting is the quoting.
status=$emit.output.status          # → status='ok' → bash assigns: ok
[ "$status" = "ok" ] && echo pass   # → passes
```

For **large** outputs (>32 KB) the substitution is `$(cat '/path')`, where `var="$(cat ...)"` is correct bash — but you can't know the size at author time, so the rule is unconditional. Numeric and boolean **fields** are injected raw (no quotes), so double-quoting accidentally "works" for them — which makes the bug intermittent. Always use `var=$node.output.field`, never `var="$node.output.field"`.

### Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: classify
    command: classify-issue
    output_format:
      type: object
      properties:
        type: { type: string, enum: [BUG, FEATURE] }
      required: [type]

  - id: fix
    prompt: |
      The issue was classified as: $classify.output.type
      Full classification: $classify.output
      User's original request: $USER_MESSAGE
    depends_on: [classify]
```

## Substitution Order

Variables are substituted in a defined order:

1. **Workflow variables** -- `$WORKFLOW_ID`, `$USER_MESSAGE`, `$ARGUMENTS`, `$ARTIFACTS_DIR`, `$BASE_BRANCH`, `$DOCS_DIR`, `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`, `$REJECTION_REASON`, `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`
2. **Context variables** -- `$CONTEXT`, `$EXTERNAL_CONTEXT`, `$ISSUE_CONTEXT`
3. **Node output references** -- `$nodeId.output`, `$nodeId.output.field`

Inside a `loop_group` body, `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output` refs are resolved
first (before `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` is spliced in, so user-provided text is never
re-processed as a workflow ref), then the node's normal substitution runs.

Positional arguments (`$1` through `$9`) are substituted separately by the command handler and are only available when commands are invoked directly, not through workflow nodes.

## Variable Availability by Context

| Variable | Workflow nodes | Direct command invocation | `when:` conditions |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` / `$USER_MESSAGE` | Yes | Yes (as `$ARGUMENTS`) | No |
| `$1` ... `$9` | No | Yes | No |
| `$WORKFLOW_ID` | Yes | No | No |
| `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` | Yes | No | No |
| `$BASE_BRANCH` | Yes | No | No |
| `$DOCS_DIR` | Yes | No | No |
| `$CONTEXT` / aliases | Yes | No | No |
| `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` | Yes (loop nodes) | No | No |
| `$REJECTION_REASON` | Yes (`on_reject` only) | No | No |
| `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` | Yes (loop nodes) | No | No |
| `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output` | Yes (loop_group body nodes) | No | No |
| `$nodeId.output` | Yes (DAG nodes) | No | Yes |

## Authentication Environment Variables

These are standard environment variables read from `process.env` at clone time. They are **not** workflow-substituted variables — they must be set in your shell environment or `.env` file before Archon starts.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token for authenticated clone operations |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | GitLab personal or project access token (`glpat-*`) for authenticated GitLab clones |
| `GITEA_TOKEN` | Gitea API token for authenticated Gitea/Forgejo clones |
