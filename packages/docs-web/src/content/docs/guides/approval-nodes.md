DAG workflow nodes support an `approval` field that pauses workflow execution
until a human approves or rejects the gate. Use approval nodes to insert human
review steps between AI-driven nodes — for example, reviewing a generated plan
before committing to expensive implementation work.

## Quick Start

> **Web UI users:** Add `interactive: true` at the workflow level. Without it, the
> workflow dispatches to a background worker and approval gate messages won't appear
> in your chat window. See [Web Execution Mode](/guides/authoring-workflows/#web-execution-mode).

```yaml
name: plan-approve-implement
description: Plan, get approval, then implement
interactive: true   # Required for Web UI: ensures approval gates appear in chat

nodes:
  - id: plan
    prompt: |
      Analyze the codebase and create a detailed implementation plan.
      $USER_MESSAGE

  - id: review-gate
    approval:
      message: "Review the plan above before proceeding with implementation."
    depends_on: [plan]

  - id: implement
    command: implement
    depends_on: [review-gate]
```

When execution reaches `review-gate`, the workflow pauses and sends a message
to the user on whatever platform they're using (CLI, Slack, GitHub, etc.). On the
**Web UI**, `interactive: true` is required for the message to appear in your chat.

## How It Works

1. **Pause**: The executor sets the workflow run status to `paused` and stores
   the approval context (node ID and message) in the run's metadata.
2. **Notify**: A message is sent to the user with the approval prompt and
   instructions for approving or rejecting.
3. **Wait**: The workflow stays paused until the user takes action. Paused runs
   block the worktree path guard (no other workflow can start on the same path).
4. **Approve**: The user approves, which writes a `node_completed` event for
   the approval node and transitions the run to resumable. Every approve surface
   also continues the run: the `/workflow approve <run-id>` slash command, the
   CLI, the Web UI approve button, the in-thread **Approve** button posted by the
   Slack adapter, and a chat agent resolving the gate on your behalf after you
   tell it to.
5. **Reject**: The user rejects.
   - **Without `on_reject`**: The workflow is cancelled immediately.
   - **With `on_reject`**: The executor runs the `on_reject.prompt` via AI (with
     `$REJECTION_REASON` substituted), then re-pauses at the same gate. This
     repeats until the user approves or `on_reject.max_attempts` is reached, at
     which point the workflow is cancelled.

## YAML Schema

```yaml
- id: gate-name
  approval:
    message: "Human-readable prompt shown to the user"
    capture_response: true    # optional: store comment as $gate-name.output
    on_reject:                # optional: AI rework on rejection instead of cancel
      prompt: "Fix based on feedback: $REJECTION_REASON"
      max_attempts: 3         # optional: default 3, range 1–10
  depends_on: [upstream-node]  # optional
  when: "$plan.output.ready == 'true'"  # optional condition (see note below)
  trigger_rule: all_success    # optional (default: all_success)
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `approval.message` | string | Yes | The message shown to the user when the workflow pauses |
| `approval.capture_response` | boolean | No | When `true`, the user's approval comment is stored as `$<node-id>.output` for downstream nodes. Default: `false` |
| `approval.on_reject.prompt` | string | No | Prompt template run via AI when the user rejects. `$REJECTION_REASON` is substituted with the reject reason. After running, the workflow re-pauses at the same gate |
| `approval.on_reject.max_attempts` | integer | No | Max times the on_reject prompt runs before the workflow is cancelled. Range: 1–10. Default: 3 |

Approval nodes do not support AI-specific fields (`model`, `provider`, `context`,
`output_format`, `allowed_tools`, `denied_tools`, `hooks`, `mcp`, `skills`,
`idle_timeout`) since they don't invoke an AI agent. (The `on_reject.prompt` runs
as a separate AI node using the workflow's default provider.)

Standard DAG fields (`id`, `depends_on`, `when`, `trigger_rule`) work as
expected. Note that a `when:` gating the approval cannot compare the *whole* output of
an AI producer to a literal — declare `output_format` on the producer and compare a field,
as above. See
[`when:` Condition Syntax](/guides/authoring-workflows/#when-condition-syntax).
`retry` is accepted by the schema but has **no effect** on an approval
node — the approval dispatch path never enters the retry loop. To rework a
rejected gate, use `on_reject` (see [Rejection with AI Rework](#rejection-with-ai-rework-on_reject)),
not `retry`.

## Approving and Rejecting

### Explicit Commands (all platforms)

```
/workflow approve <run-id> looks good
/workflow reject <run-id> needs changes
```

Both resolve the gate **and** continue the run — approving no longer needs a
follow-up message.

### Asking the chat agent

You can also just say what you want in the conversation. The agent reads the open
gate along with your message and decides:

```
User: "looks good, ship it"
→ agent approves the gate; the run continues

User: "no, stop — why is it editing the schema?"
→ agent rejects the gate with your words as the reason

User: "what would that change?"
→ agent answers you; the gate stays open and nothing is resolved
```

The agent passes your own words through as the approval comment or the rejection
reason, so a gate with `capture_response: true` still receives what you typed.

:::caution[Behaviour change]
Archon used to record **any** message that did not start with `/` as an approval —
including an objection, which was stored as the approval comment while the run
carried on doing the thing you objected to. Typing at a gate no longer approves by
itself. If your message is ambiguous the agent asks instead of guessing, and
nothing is resolved until you are explicit.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Providers without native tool support (Codex, OpenCode, Copilot) resolve the
  gate by running `archon workflow approve|reject <run-id>` for you instead.
- If you want a decision recorded with no interpretation at all, use the slash
  commands above — they are deterministic.

### CLI

The CLI is non-interactive — use explicit commands:

```bash
# Approve (resumes the workflow immediately)
bun run cli workflow approve <run-id>
bun run cli workflow approve <run-id> --comment "Looks good, proceed"

# Reject
# Without on_reject: cancels the workflow
# With on_reject: records feedback, triggers AI rework, re-pauses
bun run cli workflow reject <run-id>
bun run cli workflow reject <run-id> --reason "Plan needs more test coverage"
```

### Interactive-loop gates: bare approve finalizes

Interactive **loop** gates (`loop:`/`loop_group:` with `interactive: true`) share these
approve surfaces but add one rule: when the gate paused on an iteration where any declared
completion channel fired (the persisted gate message — `metadata.approval.message`, shown
by `workflow get --json` and `manage_run` — leads with `✅ Completion condition met via`
or the plural `✅ Completion conditions met via`;
in chat the same line follows the `⏸ Input required` prefix),
approving **without a comment** finalizes the loop node from the already-computed output —
no extra iteration runs. Approving **with** a comment runs another iteration with your
comment as `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`. Asking the agent to approve without passing anything on
finalizes too; if you want the finalize to be unambiguous, use `/workflow approve <id>`
with no comment, the CLI, or the web button. See
[Loop Nodes → `interactive` and `gate_message`](/guides/loop-nodes/#interactive-and-gate_message)
for the full semantics, `signal_completes`, and the AI-approver steering pattern.

### Web UI

Paused workflows show an amber pulsing badge on the dashboard. Click **Approve**
or **Reject** directly on the workflow card. Both actions auto-resume the
workflow from the paused gate — no follow-up message required.

**Reject with reason**: the Reject dialog includes an optional free-text
reason field. The trimmed value (empty after trim → omitted) is passed to
the workflow as `$REJECTION_REASON`, available in the `on_reject.prompt`.
Rejects on web and chat cards use the same confirmation dialog.

**Cross-platform caveat**: auto-resume via the Web UI only applies when the
run was originally dispatched from the Web UI (parent conversation is a web
conversation). If you approve a Slack / Telegram / GitHub-dispatched run
from the dashboard, the decision is recorded, but the resume flow has to
happen in the originating platform (re-run the workflow there).

### REST API

```bash
# Approve
curl -X POST http://localhost:3090/api/workflows/runs/<run-id>/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"comment": "Approved"}'

# Reject
curl -X POST http://localhost:3090/api/workflows/runs/<run-id>/reject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Needs revision"}'
```

## Downstream Output

By default, the user's approval comment is **not** available downstream —
`$<node-id>.output` will be an empty string. To capture the comment as node
output, set `capture_response: true`:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: gate
    approval:
      message: "Any special instructions for implementation?"
      capture_response: true   # Makes the user's comment available as $gate.output
    depends_on: [plan]

  - id: implement
    prompt: |
      Implement the plan. User instructions: $gate.output
    depends_on: [gate]
```

Without `capture_response: true`, downstream nodes should not reference
`$gate.output` — it will be an empty string.

## Rejection with AI Rework (`on_reject`)

When `on_reject` is configured, a rejection does not cancel the workflow —
instead, the executor runs an AI prompt with the rejection reason and re-pauses
at the same gate.

```yaml
- id: review-gate
  approval:
    message: "Review the implementation plan."
    capture_response: true
    on_reject:
      prompt: |
        The reviewer rejected the plan with this feedback: $REJECTION_REASON

        Revise the plan to address the feedback, then summarize the changes.
      max_attempts: 3   # After 3 rejections, the workflow is cancelled. Default: 3.
  depends_on: [plan]
```

The `$REJECTION_REASON` variable is substituted with the `--reason` text provided
by the rejecting user. After the AI rework, the workflow re-pauses so the reviewer
can approve or reject again.

### Lifecycle with on_reject

1. Workflow pauses at approval gate
2. Reviewer rejects: `rejection_count` incremented, `rejection_reason` stored
3. If `rejection_count < max_attempts`: `on_reject.prompt` runs via AI, workflow re-pauses
4. If `rejection_count >= max_attempts`: workflow cancelled

## Edge Cases

- **Multiple approval nodes**: Supported. Each pauses the workflow independently.
- **Approval in parallel layer**: Other nodes in the same layer complete normally;
  the workflow pauses at the layer boundary.
- **Server restart while paused**: The run persists in the database. The user can
  still approve or reject after restart.
- **Abandoning a paused run**: Use `/workflow abandon <id>` or the Abandon button
  on the dashboard.

## Design Notes

Approval nodes reuse the existing resume infrastructure. When approved (or
rejected with an `on_reject` rework), the run **stays `paused`** — the
resolution is recorded on the pause context as `metadata.approval.resolved`
(`'approved'` or `'rejected'`), and the resume machinery (which accepts paused
runs) picks it up via `hydrateResumableRun`. The status you see between
clicking Approve and the executor resuming is an honest `paused`, never a
transient `failed`. A `failed` run always means a real failure (it carries
`metadata.error` or `metadata.failure_reason`).
