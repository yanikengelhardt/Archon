DAG workflow nodes support a `script` field that runs a TypeScript, JavaScript,
or Python snippet as part of the workflow. No AI agent is invoked — the script
runs via the `bun` or `uv` runtime, `stdout` is captured as the node's output,
and the result is available downstream as `$nodeId.output`.

Use script nodes for deterministic work that needs a real programming language:
parsing JSON, transforming data between upstream AI nodes, calling HTTP APIs
with typed clients, or computing values that a shell one-liner would mangle.
If a plain shell command is enough, use a [`bash:` node](/guides/authoring-workflows/#node-fields)
instead.

## Quick Start

### Inline TypeScript (bun)

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: parse
    script: |
      const data = { count: 42, label: "ok" };
      console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
    runtime: bun
```

### Inline Python (uv)

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: compute
    script: |
      import json, statistics
      values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      print(json.dumps({ "mean": statistics.mean(values) }))
    runtime: uv
```

### Named script from `.archon/scripts/`

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: fetch-pages
    script: fetch-github-pages   # resolves .archon/scripts/fetch-github-pages.ts
    runtime: bun
    timeout: 60000
```

The file `.archon/scripts/fetch-github-pages.ts` is loaded and executed with
`bun --no-env-file run <path>`.

## How It Works

1. **Substitute variables.** `$ARGUMENTS`, `$WORKFLOW_ID`, `$ARTIFACTS_DIR`,
   `$BASE_BRANCH`, `$DOCS_DIR`, and upstream `$nodeId.output` references are
   substituted into the `script` text before execution.
2. **Detect inline vs named.** If the `script` value contains a newline or any
   shell metacharacter (see [Inline vs Named Scripts](#inline-vs-named-scripts)
   below), it's treated as inline code. Otherwise it's treated as a named-script
   reference.
3. **Dispatch.**
   - `runtime: bun` + inline → `bun --no-env-file -e '<code>'`
   - `runtime: bun` + named  → `bun --no-env-file run <path>`
   - `runtime: uv` + inline  → `uv run [--with dep ...] python -c '<code>'`
   - `runtime: uv` + named   → `uv run [--with dep ...] <path>`
4. **Capture.** `stdout` (with the trailing newline stripped) becomes
   `$nodeId.output`. On a successful run, `stderr` is logged as a warning and
   posted to the conversation but does **not** fail the node. A non-zero exit
   code fails the node; on failure, `stderr` is the diagnostic surfaced in the
   error message (`Script node 'X' failed [exit N]: <stderr>`) — the script
   body is never echoed back to users.

## YAML Schema

```yaml
- id: node-name
  script: <inline code OR named identifier>   # required, non-empty
  runtime: bun | uv                            # required
  deps: ["httpx", "pydantic>=2"]               # optional, uv-only (see below)
  timeout: 60000                               # optional ms, default 120000
  depends_on: [upstream]                       # optional
  when: "$upstream.output != '[]'"             # optional (upstream is a bash/script node;
                                               #  an AI producer needs output_format + a field)
  trigger_rule: all_success                    # optional (default)
  retry:                                       # optional; same shape as bash/AI nodes
    max_attempts: 3
    on_error: transient
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `script` | string | Yes | Inline code, or a named script in the owning workflow's `scripts/` directory (packaged workflows) or shared script directories (legacy workflows) |
| `runtime` | `'bun'` \| `'uv'` | Yes | Which runtime executes the script. Must match the file extension for named scripts |
| `deps` | string[] | No | Python dependencies to install for this run. **uv only** — ignored with a warning for `bun` |
| `timeout` | number (ms) | No | Hard kill after this many milliseconds. Default: `120000` (2 min) |

Standard DAG fields (`id`, `depends_on`, `when`, `trigger_rule`, `retry`) all
work. AI-specific fields (`model`, `provider`, `context`, `output_format`,
`allowed_tools`, `denied_tools`, `hooks`, `mcp`, `skills`, `agents`, `effort`,
`thinking`, `maxBudgetUsd`, `systemPrompt`, `fallbackModel`, `betas`, `sandbox`)
are accepted by the parser but emit a loader warning and are ignored at runtime
— no AI is invoked. `idle_timeout` is also accepted but ignored: script nodes
run as one-shot subprocesses, so use `timeout` (hard kill after N ms) instead.

## Inline vs Named Scripts

The executor decides mode from the `script` string itself. A value is treated
as **inline code** if it contains a newline or any shell metacharacter; otherwise
it's a **named script** lookup.

- **Metacharacters that trigger inline mode:** space, `;` `(` `)` `{` `}` `&`
  `|` `<` `>` `$` `` ` `` `"` `'`
- **Inline examples:** `"const x = 1; console.log(x)"`, multi-line blocks, any
  snippet with a space
- **Named examples:** `fetch-pages`, `analyze_metrics`, `triage-fmt` — bare
  identifiers with no whitespace or shell syntax

If you want an inline snippet that happens to be syntactically a single
identifier, add a trailing comment or newline to force inline mode.

### Named Script Resolution

Named scripts use one of two resolution modes:

- **Packaged workflow:** resolve only from the owning workflow's `scripts/` directory. Bundled package scripts use the same ownership rule and are embedded for binary distribution.
- **Legacy workflow:** resolve shared scripts from `<repoRoot>/.archon/scripts/`, then `~/.archon/scripts/`.

Workflow-local lookup is scoped to the workflow that declared the node, including through `include:` expansion. Authors still write only the bare name (`script: publish`); the ownership key is internal.

Each shared scripts directory is walked one subfolder deep (e.g. `.archon/scripts/triage/foo.ts`
resolves as `foo`). Deeper nesting is ignored. On a same-name collision the
repo-local entry wins silently — see [Global Workflows](/guides/global-workflows/)
for the shared precedence rules.

### Extension ↔ Runtime Mapping

Named scripts derive their runtime from the file extension:

| Extension | Runtime |
|-----------|---------|
| `.ts`, `.js` | `bun` |
| `.py` | `uv` |

The `runtime:` declared on the node **must match the file's extension** — the
validator rejects `runtime: uv` pointing at a `.ts` file, and vice versa. For
inline scripts, you can use any language that the chosen runtime supports.

## Dependencies (uv only)

`deps` is a pass-through to `uv run --with <dep>`, which installs packages into
a per-run ephemeral environment:

```yaml
- id: scrape
  script: |
    import httpx
    r = httpx.get("https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook")
    print(r.text)
  runtime: uv
  deps: ["httpx>=0.27"]
```

- **Version pinning** — any PEP 508 specifier works (`pkg==1.2.3`, `pkg>=2,<3`).
- **Bun ignores `deps`** — Bun auto-installs imported packages on first run, so
  the validator emits a warning if you set `deps` with `runtime: bun`. Remove
  the field, or switch to `uv` if you need explicit dependency management.
- **No persistent environment** — each run is isolated; there is no `requirements.txt`
  or lockfile to maintain.

## Output and Data Flow

`stdout` (trimmed of its trailing newline) becomes `$nodeId.output`. Print JSON
if you want downstream nodes to access structured fields with
`$nodeId.output.field` — the workflow engine tries to parse the output as JSON
for field access in `when:` conditions and prompt substitution.

```yaml
- id: classify
  script: |
    const input = process.argv.slice(2).join(' ');
    const severity = input.includes('crash') ? 'high' : 'low';
    console.log(JSON.stringify({ severity, length: input.length }));
  runtime: bun

- id: investigate
  command: investigate-bug
  depends_on: [classify]
  when: "$classify.output.severity == 'high'"
```

### Variable Substitution in Scripts

Variables are substituted into the `script` text **as raw strings, without
shell quoting** — unlike `bash:` nodes, where `$nodeId.output` values are
auto-quoted. Treat substituted values as untrusted input and parse them with
language features, not by interpolating into shell syntax.

:::caution[Avoid String.raw with `$nodeId.output`]
The pattern `` String.raw`$nodeId.output` `` looks safe but fails silently when
the substituted value contains a backtick — common in AI-generated markdown,
`output_format` payloads, or any output with inline code spans. The backtick
terminates the template literal early, producing a cryptic `Expected ";"` parse
error at runtime.

**Use direct assignment instead.** JSON is a strict subset of JavaScript
expression syntax, so the substituted value is always a valid JS literal:

```typescript
// Safe — works for any valid JSON, including content with backticks
const data = $fetch-issue.output;

// Fragile — breaks if output contains a backtick
const data = JSON.parse(String.raw`$fetch-issue.output`);  // DON'T
```
:::

For **named scripts**, variables are not passed automatically. Read them from
the environment (`process.env.USER_MESSAGE`, `os.environ['USER_MESSAGE']`)
or accept them via stdin. For **inline scripts**, substituted variables are
literally embedded into the code string at execution time.

## Environment and Isolation

:::note[Shell injection prevention]
User-controlled workflow variables like `$USER_MESSAGE` and `$ARGUMENTS` are passed to `bash:` nodes as environment variables (not inline-substituted into the shell command) to prevent shell injection. Script nodes receive these values the same way via `process.env`.
:::

Script subprocesses receive `process.env` merged with any codebase-scoped env
vars you've configured via the Web UI (Settings → Projects → Env Vars) or the
`env:` block in `.archon/config.yaml`. This is the same injection surface used
by Claude, Codex, and bash nodes.

**Target repo `.env` isolation:** the Bun subprocess is invoked with
`--no-env-file`, so variables in the target repo's `.env` do **not** leak into
the script. Archon-managed env (from `~/.archon/.env` and `<repo>/.archon/.env`)
passes through normally. `uv`-launched Python subprocesses do not auto-load
`.env` at all. See [Security Model](/reference/security/#target-repo-env-isolation)
for the full story.

## Validation

`archon validate workflows <name>` checks script nodes for:

- **Script file exists** — for named scripts, the basename must exist in the
  owning workflow's `scripts/` directory or the legacy shared search path, with
  a matching extension for the declared runtime. Missing files fail validation
  with a hint showing the expected path.
- **Runtime available on PATH** — `bun` or `uv` must be installed. Missing
  runtimes emit a warning with the official install command:
  - `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
  - `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **`deps` with `runtime: bun`** — warns that `deps` is a no-op under Bun.

Runtime availability is cached per-process — the check spawns `which bun` /
`which uv` once and memoizes the result.

## Patterns

### Transform AI output before the next node

Use a script node as a deterministic adapter between two AI nodes. The script
parses the upstream classifier's JSON, filters, and forwards a clean payload:

```yaml
- id: classify
  prompt: "Classify: $ARGUMENTS"
  allowed_tools: []
  output_format:
    type: object
    properties:
      items:
        type: array
        items: { type: object }

- id: filter
  script: |
    const upstream = JSON.parse(process.env.UPSTREAM ?? '{}');
    const high = (upstream.items ?? []).filter(i => i.severity === 'high');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(high));
  runtime: bun
  depends_on: [classify]

- id: triage
  command: triage-high-severity
  depends_on: [filter]
  when: "$filter.output != '[]'"
```

*(Note: to actually populate `UPSTREAM` you'd inline-substitute
`$classify.output` into the script body. The example above illustrates the
shape.)*

### Reusable helper in `~/.archon/scripts/`

A helper you want available in every repo — say, a triage summary formatter —
lives at `~/.archon/scripts/triage-fmt.ts`:

```typescript
// ~/.archon/scripts/triage-fmt.ts
const raw = process.argv.slice(2).join(' ') || '{}';
const data = JSON.parse(raw);
const lines = data.issues?.map((i: { id: string; title: string }) =>
  `- [${i.id}] ${i.title}`
).join('\n') ?? '';
console.log(lines || 'no issues');
```

Then reference it by name from any repo's workflow:

```yaml
- id: format
  script: triage-fmt
  runtime: bun
  depends_on: [gather]
```

### Python with scientific dependencies

```yaml
- id: analyze
  script: |
    import json, sys
    import pandas as pd
    data = json.loads(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else []
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(df.describe().to_json())
  runtime: uv
  deps: ["pandas>=2.0"]
  depends_on: [collect]
```

## What Does NOT Work

- **AI-only features** — `hooks`, `mcp`, `skills`, `allowed_tools`,
  `denied_tools`, `agents`, `model`, `provider`, `output_format`, `effort`,
  `thinking`, `maxBudgetUsd`, `systemPrompt`, `fallbackModel`, `betas`, and
  `sandbox` are all ignored at runtime. The loader emits a warning listing
  the ignored fields.
- **Interactive prompts** — the script runs headlessly; any `stdin` read will
  see EOF immediately.
- **Runtimes other than `bun` and `uv`** — rejected at parse time.
- **Cancelling mid-execution** — script subprocesses are killed on workflow
  cancel, but there's no cooperative cancellation signal. Design scripts to
  complete quickly or fail fast.
