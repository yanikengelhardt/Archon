DAG workflow nodes support a `loop` field that runs an AI prompt repeatedly
until a completion condition is met. Each iteration is a full AI agent session
that can read files, write code, run commands, and produce output.

Use loop nodes for autonomous multi-step work: implement N stories from a PRD,
iterate on a design until validation passes, or refine output until quality
criteria are met.

A loop node's iteration prompt can live **inline** (`loop.prompt`) or in a
**command file** (`loop.command`, resolved the same way
[`command:` nodes](/guides/authoring-commands/) load their text). Provide
exactly one — both at once, or neither, is rejected at workflow load time.

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: iterate-until-done
description: Implement stories one at a time
nodes:
  - id: setup
    bash: |
      echo "Found 3 stories to implement"

  - id: implement
    depends_on: [setup]
    loop:
      prompt: |
        Read the PRD and implement the next unfinished story.
        Validate your changes before committing.

        Setup context: $setup.output
        User request: $USER_MESSAGE

        When all stories are done, output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
      until: COMPLETE
      max_iterations: 10
      fresh_context: true

  - id: report
    depends_on: [implement]
    prompt: |
      Summarize what was implemented: $implement.output
```

## How It Works

A loop node iterates its prompt until one of these conditions is met:

1. **LLM completion signal** — the AI outputs `<promise>SIGNAL</promise>` where
   SIGNAL matches the `until` value
2. **Deterministic bash check** — an `until_bash` script exits with code 0
3. **Structured field** — the iteration's validated `output_format` payload has the
   `until_field` property set to `true`
4. **Max iterations reached** — the node fails with a clear error

A loop must declare **at least one** of `until` / `until_bash` / `until_field` — none
is required on its own. They are OR'd: whichever fires first ends the loop, and the
cheap channels are checked before `until_bash`, which is skipped once another one
fired (it cannot change the outcome, and skipping it avoids an extra run of a
side-effecting script).

Each iteration is a full AI agent invocation with tool access. Between iterations,
the executor checks for workflow cancellation.

### Choosing a completion channel

| Your completion condition | Declare |
|---|---|
| Externally checkable — tests pass, a file exists, a state field flipped | `until_bash` **only**. No prose is matched, so a sentinel the model happens to emit while reasoning about the criteria cannot end the loop early. |
| A judgment the model makes, no human in the loop | `output_format` + `until_field`. The decision becomes a schema-validated boolean instead of a string match — the model cannot end the loop by mentioning a word. |
| A judgment the model makes, shown to a human at a gate | `until` (with `interactive`). The iteration's output is a message a person reads and replies to, so prose is the right medium — declaring `output_format` would replace it with JSON. |

Declaring more than one is fine and means "whichever fires first ends it".

## Configuration Fields

```yaml
- id: my-loop
  loop:
    prompt: "..."           # Inline prompt. Exactly one of `prompt` or `command` is required.
    # command: <name>       # Alternative to `prompt`: package-local or shared command name,
    #                       # loaded once per run and reused for every iteration.
    #                       # Never combine with `prompt` — the loader rejects both together.
    until: COMPLETE         # Prose completion signal.
    max_iterations: 10      # Required. Hard limit — node fails if exceeded.
    fresh_context: true     # Optional. Default: false.
    until_bash: "..."       # Bash script checked after each iteration; exit 0 = complete.
    until_field: done       # Property in this node's `output_format` whose validated
                            # value `true` ends the loop.
                            #
                            # At least ONE completion channel is required — any of
                            # until / until_bash / until_field. None is required alone.
    interactive: true       # Optional. Default: false. Pause after each non-completing
                            # iteration for user input via /workflow approve.
    gate_message: "..."     # Required when interactive: true. Message shown to the
                            # user at each pause with the run ID and approve command.
    signal_completes: true  # Optional. Default: false. Interactive loops only: a detected
                            # completion signal completes the node immediately (even on
                            # iteration 1) instead of gating for confirmation.
```

### `prompt`

The prompt text sent to the AI each iteration. Supports all standard variable
substitution:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` / `$USER_MESSAGE` | Original user message |
| `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` | Workflow artifacts directory |
| `$BASE_BRANCH` | Repository base branch |
| `$DOCS_DIR` | Documentation directory path (default: `docs/`) |
| `$WORKFLOW_ID` | Current workflow run ID |
| `$nodeId.output` | Output from upstream nodes |
| `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` | User feedback provided via `/workflow approve <id> <text>` at an interactive loop gate. Only populated on the first iteration of a resumed interactive loop; empty string on all other iterations. |
| `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` | Cleaned output of the previous loop iteration. Empty string on the first iteration. Useful for `fresh_context: true` loops that need to reference what the previous pass produced or why it failed. |

`$USER_MESSAGE` is particularly important for `fresh_context: true` loops —
the agent has no memory of prior iterations, so the prompt must include all
context needed to continue the work. `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` complements this by
exposing the previous iteration's own output without forcing the engine to
thread the session.

### `command`

Alternative to `prompt` — names a command file
whose body is loaded as the iteration prompt. **Exactly one of `prompt` or
`command` is required**; specifying both, or neither, is rejected at workflow
load time with a clear error.

The named command resolves exactly like a [`command:` node](/guides/authoring-commands/).
In a packaged workflow it resolves only from that workflow's `commands/`
directory, including after `include:` expansion. In a legacy workflow it uses
repo → home → bundled precedence. The same command-name safety
rules apply — no path separators, no `..`, no leading `.` — and unsafe names
are rejected at parse time. Static workflow validation also flags a
`loop.command` that points at a missing file, with guidance to create it in the
owning workflow's `commands/` directory for packaged workflows or in
`.archon/commands/` for legacy workflows, the same way it does for `command:`
nodes.

For an ordinary workflow, the file is **read once per run** when the loop node
starts. For a workflow composed through `include:`, Archon resolves and compiles
the command body during load-time composition so its node references and declared
inputs are proven before the child joins the parent's flat DAG. A matching file
that is unreadable fails closed; Archon never falls through to a lower-precedence
command with the same name. A missing, empty, unreadable, or non-hermetic included
command fails before a fresh AI turn.

For any interactive loop — whether authored with `prompt` or `command` — Archon
persists the resolved prompt template at the gate. A resumed run prefers that
snapshot, so editing inline YAML or a command source while the run is paused does
not change its prompt; deleting a command source does not break that resume either.
Source edits affect fresh runs, which still require successful command resolution
or compilation.

Once loaded, the text behaves identically to an inline `prompt`: all the
variable substitution above applies unchanged (including `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`
and `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`), as do all the iteration semantics (`until`,
`until_bash`, `max_iterations`, `fresh_context`, `interactive` /
`gate_message`).

```yaml
- id: implement
  model: opus
  depends_on: [generate-prd]
  loop:
    command: archon-ralph-implement   # resolved repo → home → bundled (see precedence above)
    until: COMPLETE
    max_iterations: 15
    fresh_context: true
```

Use this when the iteration prompt is long enough that keeping it inline
obscures the shape of the pipeline — Ralph-style implement/build loops and
iterate-until-valid loops are the typical case. It is the loop-node parallel
of moving a `prompt:` node to a `command:` node.

### `until`

The completion signal string. The executor checks each iteration's output for:

1. **Tag format (recommended):** `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` — case-insensitive
   match (both tags and signal value), whitespace-tolerant. Prevents false
   positives from the AI mentioning the signal word in discussion.
2. **Plain signal (fallback):** The signal at the very end of output (trailing
   whitespace and punctuation tolerated) or on its own line. More prone to
   false positives — prefer the tag format.

The `<promise>` tags are automatically stripped from output sent to the user
and to downstream nodes.

**Optional, like every completion channel.** Omit `until` entirely whenever another
channel decides completion — the executor then never matches prose at all, so the
signal cannot false-positive on a model that mentions its own exit criterion. What
the loader requires is that *at least one* channel is declared; a loop with none is
rejected at load.

### `max_iterations`

Hard safety limit. If the loop reaches this count without meeting any declared
completion channel, the node **fails** (not succeeds). This prevents runaway loops
from burning tokens indefinitely.

Choose based on the work scope:
- Simple refinement loops: 3–5
- Multi-story implementation: 10–15
- Long-running autonomous agents: 15–20

### `fresh_context`

Controls session continuity between iterations:

| Value | Behavior | Use when |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `true` | Each iteration starts a fresh AI session. No memory of prior iterations. | Work state lives on disk (files, git). Prevents context window exhaustion on long loops. |
| `false` (default) | Sessions thread — each iteration resumes the prior conversation. | Iterative refinement where the agent needs to remember what it tried before. |

The first iteration is always fresh regardless of this setting.

A structured-output re-ask (see [`until_field`](#until_field)) does **not** disturb
threading. It runs in its own throwaway session so an invalid turn is not carried
forward as context, and that session is discarded — the next iteration still resumes
the conversation the loop was already threading. The repaired answer still reaches it
through `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`.

### `until_bash`

Bash script executed after each iteration. If it exits with code 0, the loop
completes — even if the AI didn't output the completion signal. Optional when
`until` is set; **on its own it is the whole completion channel**, which is the
preferred shape whenever the condition is externally checkable:

```yaml
loop:
  prompt: "Fix the failing tests"
  max_iterations: 5
  until_bash: "bun run test"  # Loop ends when tests pass. No `until:` — nothing to
                              # false-positive on, and no dead field to invent.
```

`until_bash` runs only on iterations that no other completion channel already
ended, so a loop declaring more than one never pays for a redundant check.

:::caution[If your `until_bash` accumulates state]
The skip means the script does not run on an iteration another channel already
completed, so a check that *mutates* state each time it runs — a counter, an append,
a cursor — advances once fewer than it would have. The completion verdict is unaffected either way (the
channels are OR'd), and a non-interactive loop ends on that same iteration, so
nothing observable differs.

The one case where the timing does shift: an **interactive** loop whose first run
completes on another channel still gates rather than finishing (unless
`signal_completes: true`). If you
then approve *with text*, another iteration runs — and its `until_bash` sees state
one increment behind where it would have been. A state-accumulating check therefore
reaches its threshold one iteration later. Approving with no text finalizes from the
already-computed output and does not diverge at all.

Prefer a `until_bash` that only *reads* state — `test`, `grep`, a test suite — and
let a `bash:` node inside the loop own any mutation.
:::

This is useful for deterministic completion criteria: test suites, lint checks,
build success. The bash script supports the same variable substitution as
`prompt` (`$ARTIFACTS_DIR`, `$nodeId.output`, etc.). Note: `$nodeId.output`
values are shell-escaped when substituted into `until_bash`. The same
double-quoting footgun that applies to `bash:` nodes applies here — see
[Shell Quoting in `bash:` vs `script:`](/reference/variables#shell-quoting-in-bash-vs-script)
for the unquoted idiom to use.

### `until_field`

Names a property in this node's [`output_format`](/guides/authoring-workflows/) schema.
The loop ends on the first iteration whose **validated** payload has that property
set to exactly `true`.

```yaml
- id: triage
  output_format:
    type: object
    properties:
      done: { type: boolean }
      remaining: { type: integer }
    required: [done]
  loop:
    prompt: |
      Work the next item in the backlog. Report whether the backlog is now empty.
    max_iterations: 20
    until_field: done
```

Use this when completion is a **judgment the model makes** and there is nothing on
disk to test. It replaces a prose sentinel with a schema-validated boolean, so the
model cannot end the loop by mentioning a word while reasoning about its criteria.

Four rules are checked at load time, so a mistake fails the workflow rather than
looping silently:

1. the node must declare `output_format`;
2. the property must appear in `output_format.properties`;
3. it must be listed in `output_format.required` — an optional property the model
   omits would read as "not complete" and burn `max_iterations`;
4. if it declares a `type`, that type must be `boolean`.

Termination is strict identity: `true` ends the loop, and nothing else does — not
`"true"`, not `1`. A payload that fails schema validation is a failure, not a
quiet "not done yet" (see below).

**The loop's output becomes the validated JSON.** With `output_format` declared,
`$loopId.output` is the payload rather than the prose, `$loopId.output.<field>` gets
the same strict field access every other producer enforces, and `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`
carries the same value.

**Per-provider behavior is the same as any other node.** On a provider with
*enforced* structured output (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) the schema constrains
decoding. On a *best-effort* provider (Pi, Copilot) the schema is appended to the
prompt, and a payload that fails validation is re-asked up to three times **within
the same iteration** — a reask does not consume a loop iteration. If those are
exhausted, the node **fails** with the validation errors; it is never treated as an
incomplete iteration. See
[provider capabilities](/reference/provider-capabilities/).

`until_field` is **not supported on `loop_group`**, and deliberately so: a group's
body node can already declare `output_format` and be read by a deterministic check,
which is the existing way to express the same thing.

```yaml
# loop_group equivalent — no new field needed
loop_group:
  max_iterations: 10
  until_bash: '[ "$decide.output.done" = "true" ]'
  nodes:
    - id: decide
      output_format:
        type: object
        properties: { done: { type: boolean } }
        required: [done]
      prompt: Is the backlog empty?
```

## Patterns

### Stateless agent (Ralph pattern)

Each iteration reads state from disk, does one unit of work, writes state back.
The prompt tells the agent it has no memory and must bootstrap from files.

```yaml
- id: implement
  depends_on: [setup]
  idle_timeout: 600000
  loop:
    prompt: |
      You are in a FRESH session — no memory of previous iterations.
      Read the PRD tracking file to find the next unfinished story.
      Implement it, validate, commit, update tracking.
      When all stories are done: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

      Project context: $setup.output
    until: COMPLETE
    max_iterations: 15
    fresh_context: true
```

**When to use:** Multi-story implementation, long-running tasks where context
window exhaustion is a risk. The agent reads `.archon/ralph/*/prd.json` or
similar tracking files to know what's done and what's next.

### Retry-on-failure with `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`

When `fresh_context: true` is needed (to keep each iteration's context window
small) but the agent still benefits from knowing what the previous pass said —
typical of implement→validate or generate→review loops — inject the previous
iteration's output via `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`:

```yaml
- id: implement-and-qa
  loop:
    prompt: |
      Implement the plan, then run `bun run validate`.
      If checks fail, fix the failures.

      Previous iteration output (empty on first pass):
      $LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT

      Use the above to focus your fixes. When all checks pass output:
      <promise>QA_PASS</promise>
    until: QA_PASS
    fresh_context: true
    max_iterations: 3
```

In a continuous run, the first iteration sees `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` substituted
to an empty string; iterations 2+ see the previous iteration's cleaned output
(after `<promise>` tags are stripped).

When a loop resumes from an interactive approval gate, the first executed
iteration after the resume also receives an empty `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` even if
its numeric iteration is 2+ — the prior output lived in a different run and is
not carried across the gate.

### Accumulating context

The agent builds on its own prior work across iterations. Good for iterative
refinement where remembering previous attempts matters.

```yaml
- id: refine
  loop:
    prompt: |
      Review the current implementation and improve it.
      Run validation after each change.
      When validation passes with zero issues: <promise>DONE</promise>
    until: DONE
    max_iterations: 5
    fresh_context: false
```

**When to use:** Fix-iterate cycles, design refinement, test-driven development
where the agent needs to remember what it already tried.

### Deterministic exit with `until_bash`

Combine LLM work with a deterministic completion check:

```yaml
- id: fix-tests
  loop:
    prompt: |
      Run the test suite. Read the failures. Fix them one at a time.
      If all tests pass: <promise>TESTS_PASS</promise>
    until: TESTS_PASS
    max_iterations: 8
    until_bash: "bun run test"
    fresh_context: false
```

The loop ends either when the AI signals completion or when the bash check
succeeds — whichever comes first.

**No channel vetoes another.** They are OR'd, so an AI that emits `TESTS_PASS`
while tests still fail ends the loop anyway — the bash check never gets to disagree. If the tests
are the real exit criterion, say so by dropping `until` and the sentence that
teaches the model to emit it:

```yaml
- id: fix-tests
  loop:
    prompt: Run the test suite. Read the failures. Fix them one at a time.
    max_iterations: 8
    until_bash: "bun run test"
    fresh_context: false
```

Now the only way out is a passing suite.

## Node Features

### What works on loop nodes

- `depends_on` — upstream dependencies
- `when` — conditional execution
- `trigger_rule` — join semantics
- `idle_timeout` — per-iteration timeout (default: 30 minutes)
- `provider` / `model` — node-level overrides are resolved and used for every iteration
- `$nodeId.output` — downstream nodes receive the last iteration's output

### `interactive` and `gate_message`

Set `interactive: true` to pause the loop between iterations and wait for human input.
After each iteration the executor:

1. Sends the gate message to the user along with the run ID and a `/workflow approve` command.
   The gate text is engine-generated: a status line naming the completion channel or channels
   that ended the iteration, or every declared channel when none did, plus a bounded excerpt of
   the iteration output — followed by your `gate_message`, so the gate always reports the real
   iteration outcome. The status line **leads the persisted gate message**
   (`metadata.approval.message`, also the
   `approval_requested` event data — what `workflow get --json` and `manage_run` read);
   the chat-delivered message wraps the same text in a `⏸ Input required (loop ..., iteration N):`
   prefix, so in chat the status line appears right after that prefix.
2. Pauses the workflow run
3. Waits — the workflow resumes when the user runs `/workflow approve <id> [feedback]`

The user's feedback is injected into the next iteration's prompt via `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`.

**Approve semantics (finalize vs iterate).** What an approve does depends on whether any declared
completion channel ended the paused iteration:

- **Gate paused on a completed iteration** (the status line starts
  `✅ Completion condition met via` for one completed channel or
  `✅ Completion conditions met via` for several): `/workflow approve <id>` with **no
  feedback** *accepts the completion* — the node
  finalizes from the already-computed output and the workflow proceeds, with **no re-run**.
  Approving **with feedback** discards that completion and runs another iteration with your
  feedback as `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`.
- **Gate paused without a completed condition** (the status line starts
  `⚠️ No completion condition met in this iteration`): both forms run another iteration
  (there is nothing to finalize).

The same rule applies on every approve surface: chat `/workflow approve`, the CLI
(`archon workflow approve <id> [--json]` — omit the comment to finalize), the HTTP
endpoint (omit `comment`), the web console ("Accept & complete" with an empty comment
field), and the `manage_run` chat tool (no `message`, or `accept: true`).

A plain chat message at a loop gate is not itself an approve — the same rule now holds
at [approval gates](/guides/approval-nodes/#asking-the-chat-agent). Say what you want and
the agent resolves the gate for you, passing your words through as the feedback; ask a
question and nothing is resolved. Because your words travel as the approve comment, that
route iterates. To finalize, use `/workflow approve <id>` with no comment, the CLI/web
surfaces above, `manage_run` with `accept: true`, or `signal_completes`.

### `signal_completes` — autonomous completion

By default an interactive loop **always gates first**, even when the very first iteration reaches
a completion condition — the human confirms before the node completes. If you want a completed
iteration to finish the node immediately (no gate, no approve), set `signal_completes: true`:

```yaml
  - id: validate
    loop:
      prompt: |
        Run the validation suite. On PASS output <promise>VALIDATED</promise>.
        On failure, describe what failed and wait for instructions.
      until: VALIDATED
      max_iterations: 5
      interactive: true
      gate_message: Validation did not pass — review the failures above.
      signal_completes: true   # signal ⇒ node completes immediately, no gate
```

With `signal_completes: true` the gate only appears on iterations where no declared completion
channel fired — the pattern for "pass through on success, pause for a human on failure". The flag
has no effect on non-interactive loops (a completed iteration already finishes them); setting it
without `interactive: true` emits a loader warning.

**AI approvers / relay steering.** An orchestrating agent can steer another run's gate:
read the structured gate state first (`archon workflow get <id> --json` →
`.metadata.approval.completionSignaled`, or the `manage_run` `get` action, which prints
`completionSignaled`, the iteration, and an output excerpt), then finalize with
`archon workflow approve <id> --json` (no comment) or `manage_run` approve with
`accept: true` — or iterate by passing feedback. The `--json` approve records the decision
without resuming; a later `resume` executes the finalize or the next iteration.

> **Note**: Interactive loop nodes require `interactive: true` at the **workflow level** as
> well. If only the loop node has `interactive: true`, a loader warning is emitted and the
> workflow will not pause correctly in web background mode.

```yaml
name: guided-refine
description: Refine output with human review between iterations.
interactive: true            # Required at workflow level for interactive loops
nodes:
  - id: refine
    loop:
      prompt: |
        Review the current draft and improve it based on this feedback: $LOOP_USER_INPUT

        When the output is satisfactory, output: <promise>DONE</promise>
      until: DONE
      max_iterations: 5
      interactive: true
      gate_message: Review the output above. Reply with your feedback or type DONE to finish.
```

### What is NOT supported on loop nodes

- `retry` — rejected at parse time. The loader fails the workflow if `retry:` is set on a loop node.
- `context: fresh` — silently ignored. Session control is handled exclusively by `fresh_context` within the `loop:` config
- `hooks` — per-node SDK hooks are not passed through to loop iterations
- `mcp` — per-node MCP server configs are not loaded for loop nodes
- `skills` — skill preloading is not applied to loop iterations
- `allowed_tools` / `denied_tools` — tool restrictions are not enforced on loop iterations

These fields (except `retry`) are silently discarded at parse time with a
loader warning — the workflow still loads but the fields have no effect.
`retry` is the exception: it causes a hard load error.

The loop executor manages its own AI sessions independently from the standard
node executor. If you need hooks, MCP, skills, or tool restrictions, consider
using a command node that wraps the iterative logic in a command file.

## Output

A loop node's output (available via `$nodeId.output` to downstream nodes) is
the **last iteration's output only** — not a concatenation of all iterations.

If you need to accumulate results across iterations, write them to files in
`$ARTIFACTS_DIR` and have the downstream node read from there.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Iteration throws an error | Node fails immediately (no more iterations) |
| Max iterations exceeded | Node fails with descriptive error |
| Workflow cancelled | Detected between iterations, node stops |
| Idle timeout per iteration | Iteration completes with whatever output was collected; loop continues to next iteration |
| `retry` configured on node | Rejected at parse time — workflow fails to load |

## Cross-Node Loops with `loop_group`

A `loop` node iterates a **single prompt**. A `loop_group` node iterates a
**multi-node sub-DAG** — a sealed body of nodes that re-runs in full each
iteration until a completion condition is met. Use it when "iterate until done"
needs a *pipeline* of steps (e.g. `implement → test → review`), not just one
repeated step.

```yaml
name: fix-until-green
description: Implement, test, and review until tests pass
nodes:
  - id: fix-loop
    loop_group:
      until: TESTS_PASS        # completion signal in the body's terminal output
      max_iterations: 5
      fresh_context: false      # false (default) = body AI sessions continue across iterations
      nodes:                    # sealed sub-DAG body — repeats as a unit
        - id: implement
          prompt: Fix the failing tests. Emit TESTS_PASS only when all pass.
          depends_on: []
        - id: test
          bash: bun test
          depends_on: [implement]
        - id: review
          prompt: Summarize the result; echo TESTS_PASS if tests are green.
          depends_on: [test]

### How it works

- From the **outer DAG's** perspective, `fix-loop` is one node. The cycle is
  *encapsulated* inside it — the outer DAG stays acyclic.
- Each iteration runs the body's topological layers in full (concurrent nodes
  within a layer run in parallel, same as a normal DAG).
- The body is **sealed**: a body node's `depends_on` may only reference sibling
  body nodes, not outer-DAG nodes. Outer context is still reachable via `$nodeId.output`
  refs in body prompts.
- Loop-control and body lifecycle events use the namespaced step name
  `{groupId}.{nodeId}` in the persisted event log, with the iteration recorded in
  event data. Nested groups compose the prefix.
- A body node that **fails** fails the whole group immediately with that node's
  error (no further iterations run) — same semantics as a failed node in a
  top-level DAG.
- `$fix-loop.output` (visible to the outer DAG) is the **final iteration's
  terminal-node output**.

### Reusing a block in the body

`include:` is valid in a `loop_group` body. Discovery expands the block before the run starts,
so each iteration executes ordinary namespaced body nodes — there is no child run or
runtime-resolved graph:

```yaml
- id: converge
  loop_group:
    until_bash: test "$review.output.ready" = true
    max_iterations: 5
    nodes:
      - id: review
        include: reusable-review
        with:
          request: $INPUTS.request
```

The block's `returns:` node supplies `$review.output`, including in `until_bash`. Internal
dependencies, inputs, gates, and namespacing behave the same as for a top-level include. A
`workflow:` node still cannot appear in a group body because it creates a separately governed
runtime sub-run rather than static composition.

### Cross-iteration references: `$LOOP_PREV`

A body node can reference a sibling's output from the **previous iteration**
with `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output` (and `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output.<field>`
for structured output):

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: fix-loop
    loop_group:
      until: TESTS_PASS
      max_iterations: 5
      nodes:
        - id: implement
          prompt: |
            Previous attempt's test output:
            $LOOP_PREV.test.output
            Fix what failed.
          depends_on: []
        - id: test
          bash: bun test
          depends_on: [implement]
```

On iteration 1 (no prior iteration), `$LOOP_PREV.*` resolves to an empty
string. Field access uses the same strict semantics as `$nodeId.output.field`
(a field not in the producer's declared schema fails the consuming node rather
than silently degrading).

### Configuration fields

`loop_group` shares the same iteration-control fields as `loop`:
[`until`](#until), [`max_iterations`](#max_iterations),
[`fresh_context`](#fresh_context), [`until_bash`](#until_bash),
[`interactive`](#interactive-and-gate_message), and `gate_message` — including the
at-least-one-of `until` / `until_bash` rule and the short-circuit between them. The
difference is the body: `loop` takes a single `prompt`; `loop_group` takes a
`nodes` array.

As with a `loop:` node (whose node-level `model`/`provider` are resolved and
applied to every iteration), `model` and `provider` set on a `loop_group` node
**are honored**: they become the default for every body AI node, overridable per
body node.

### Resume

Two distinct cases:

- **Interactive-gate resume** (`/workflow approve <id>`): the loop continues
  with the **next** iteration's whole body. With `fresh_context: false`, the
  body's AI session continues from where it paused (the session cursor is
  persisted across the gate). `$LOOP_PREV.*` refs, however, resolve to an empty
  string on the first resumed iteration — the prior iteration's body-output
  snapshot is **not** carried across the gate (same caveat as
  [`$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`](#retry-on-failure-with-loop_prev_output)).
- **Failure resume** (`/workflow resume <id>` after a crash/failure): there is
  no persisted iteration cursor — the loop_group node restarts from
  **iteration 1**. Per-body-node resume granularity is not supported in v1.

### What is NOT supported on loop_group nodes (v1)

- `until_field` / `output_format` — the group never calls the provider itself, so it
  has no payload of its own to read. Express the same thing with a body node that
  declares `output_format` plus `until_bash` reading `$node.output.field` — see
  [`until_field`](#until_field).
- `retry` (the loop manages its own iteration) — rejected at parse time.
- `persist_session` for body AI nodes across iterations — body sessions reset
  per iteration (governed by `fresh_context`).
- Per-body-node resume (skip-to-failed-body-node) — the whole iteration re-runs.
- `$LOOP_PREV.<id>.output[N]` history indexing — only the immediately prior
  iteration is reachable.
- `$LOOP_PREV.*` across an interactive pause/resume boundary — resolves to an
  empty string on the resumed iteration.

Nested `loop_group` inside a `loop_group` body is supported by construction
(the body is a normal `nodes` array), but is not hardened in v1.
