## Variables

Variables are substituted at runtime in command bodies and workflow `prompt:` fields.

| Variable | Available In | Contains |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` / `$USER_MESSAGE` | Commands, prompts | The user's whole trigger message (positional `$1`/`$2`/`$3` are not supported) |
| `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` | Commands, prompts | Absolute path to the workflow run's artifact directory |
| `$WORKFLOW_ID` | Commands, prompts | The current workflow run ID |
| `$BASE_BRANCH` | Commands, prompts | Base git branch -- `--base <branch>` (per dispatch), else `worktree.baseBranch`, else the codebase default, else auto-detected ([precedence](/reference/cli/#base-branch-precedence)) |
| `$DOCS_DIR` | Commands, prompts | Documentation directory path (default: `docs/`) |
| `$<nodeId>.output` | DAG `when:` conditions, downstream `prompt:` fields | The text output from a completed node |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Pass a module name to a command
archon workflow run my-workflow "auth"
# $ARGUMENTS = "auth", $1 = "auth"

# Multi-argument
archon workflow run my-workflow "auth refresh-tokens"
# $ARGUMENTS = "auth refresh-tokens", $1 = "auth", $2 = "refresh-tokens"
```

```yaml
# Reference a node's output in a condition
- id: implement
  command: implement-changes
  when: "$classify.output.type == 'BUG'"
```

## Workflow YAML Schema

### Top-Level Options

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | string | Identifies the workflow in `archon workflow list` |
| `description` | Yes | string | Shown in listings and used by the router |
| `nodes` | Yes | array | DAG nodes (see Node Options below) |
| `provider` | No | string | Registered provider identifier (e.g. `claude`, `codex`). Default: `claude` |
| `model` | No | string | Model for all nodes (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or full model ID) |
| `effort` | No | string | Reasoning depth on any provider that has one; also a node field: `minimal` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh` \| `max` |
| `modelReasoningEffort` | No | string | **Deprecated** — translated into `effort` at load (dropped if `effort` is also declared), with a warning: `minimal` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh` |
| `webSearchMode` | No | string | Codex only, no per-node form. Gates Codex's built-in search tool, not network access: `disabled` \| `cached` \| `live` |

### Node Options (DAG)

All nodes share these base fields:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | string | Unique node identifier; used in `depends_on` and `$nodeId.output` |
| `command` | One of | string | Package-local command name (packaged workflow) or shared command name (legacy workflow) |
| `prompt` | One of | string | Inline AI instructions |
| `bash` | One of | string | Shell script (runs without AI; stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`) |
| `script` | One of | string | TypeScript/JavaScript (bun) or Python (uv) — inline or named package-local/shared reference. Requires `runtime`. See [Script Nodes](/guides/script-nodes/) |
| `loop` | One of | object | Loop configuration (see Loop Options below) |
| `loop_group` | One of | object | Multi-node sub-DAG repeated per iteration (see Loop Group Options below) |
| `approval` | One of | object | Pause for human review; see [Approval Nodes](/guides/approval-nodes/) |
| `cancel` | One of | string | Reason string; terminates the run with `cancelled` status (not `failed`). Usually gated with `when:` |
| `include` | One of | string | Name of another workflow whose nodes are inlined at discovery as a namespaced sub-DAG; see [Composing Another Workflow](/guides/authoring-workflows/#composing-another-workflow-with-include) |
| `workflow` | One of | string | Name of another workflow run at execution time as a separate governed CHILD run (own run record, gates, artifacts, cost); see [Launching a Separate Governed Run](/guides/authoring-workflows/#launching-a-separate-governed-run-with-workflow) |
| `depends_on` | No | string[] | Node IDs that must complete before this node runs |
| `when` | No | string | Condition expression; node is skipped if false |
| `trigger_rule` | No | string | Join semantics when multiple upstreams exist (see Trigger Rules) |
| `provider` | No | string | Per-node provider override (any registered provider) |
| `model` | No | string | Per-node model override |
| `context` | No | `fresh` \| `shared` | Session context — `fresh` starts a new conversation, `shared` inherits from prior node |
| `output_format` | No | JSON Schema | Enforce structured JSON output from this node |
| `allowed_tools` | No | string[] | Restrict available tools to this list (Claude only) |
| `denied_tools` | No | string[] | Remove specific tools from this node's context (Claude only) |
| `idle_timeout` | No | number | Per-node idle timeout in milliseconds (default: 5 minutes) |
| `retry` | No | object | Retry configuration for transient failures (see Retry Options). **Hard error on loop nodes** |
| `hooks` | No | object | SDK hook callbacks (Claude only; see Hook Schema) |
| `mcp` | No | string | Path to MCP server config JSON file (Claude only) |
| `skills` | No | string[] | Declared skill names for this node; Claude omission/`[]` selects none |
| `agents` | No | object | Inline sub-agent definitions keyed by kebab-case ID. Claude only |

**Script-specific fields** (required when `script:` is set):

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `runtime` | Yes | `'bun'` \| `'uv'` | Which runtime executes the script. Must match file extension for named scripts (`.ts`/`.js` → bun, `.py` → uv) |
| `deps` | No | string[] | Python dependencies for `uv run --with`. Ignored for bun (bun auto-installs) |
| `timeout` | No | number | Hard kill in ms. Default: 120000 (2 min). Same semantics as `bash` timeout |

**Workflow (sub-run)-specific fields** (when `workflow:` is set):

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `input` | No | string | Data string forwarded as the child's `$ARGUMENTS`. Substituted like a `prompt:` body (`$nodeId.output`, workflow variables) |
| `with` | No | object | Named string values forwarded as the child's `$INPUTS`. Keys must be valid input identifiers. Mutually exclusive with `input` |
| `isolation` | No | `'inherit' \| 'worktree'` | Which checkout the child runs in. Default (and `'inherit'`) shares the parent's. `'worktree'` gives the child its own worktree + branch — opt-in only, never inferred, and it fails the node rather than falling back to the shared checkout when a worktree can't be created (folder projects, surfaces with no resolver) |
| `fan_out` | No | object | Run one child per item of a runtime list: `items` (a `$node.output` ref or literal JSON array), `max_parallel` (default `5`, bounds concurrency not total), `join` (default `all_done`), `as` (names the item as `$INPUTS.<as>` and must not collide with `with`). Every child runs to its own terminal state; none cancels another |

`retry` is rejected on `workflow:` nodes, and `workflow:` is rejected inside a `loop_group` body. The child's terminal output threads back as `$nodeId.output`; a child approval gate pauses the whole tree — approve the **child** by run id and the parent auto-resumes. A child gate is the exception: it works for a 1:1 sub-run, but a child that pauses inside a `fan_out:` expansion **fails the node** instead — a parent has one approval slot and cannot hand it to N children, so gate before or after the fan-out node rather than inside a child of it.

**Approval-specific fields** (required when `approval:` is set):

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `approval.message` | Yes | string | The message shown to the user when the workflow pauses |
| `approval.capture_response` | No | boolean | `true` = user's comment becomes `$<node-id>.output`. Default: `false` |
| `approval.on_reject.prompt` | No | string | AI rework prompt when the user rejects. `$REJECTION_REASON` substituted |
| `approval.on_reject.max_attempts` | No | number | Max rework iterations before cancel. Range 1-10, default 3 |

> **bash and script node timeout**: The `timeout` field is in **milliseconds** (default: 120000). This differs from hook `timeout`, which is in seconds.

### Trigger Rules

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `all_success` | Run only if all upstream nodes succeeded (default) |
| `one_success` | Run if at least one upstream node succeeded |
| `none_failed_min_one_success` | Run if no upstream failed and at least one succeeded |
| `all_done` | Run after all upstream nodes complete, regardless of result |

### Loop Node Options

Defined under `loop:` inside a node:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `prompt` | One of `prompt`/`command` | string | Inline AI instructions executed each iteration |
| `command` | One of `prompt`/`command` | string | Package-local or shared command whose body is the iteration prompt — exactly one of `prompt` or `command` |
| `until` | One channel required | string | Completion signal string — loop ends when AI output contains this. Omit it for a deterministic or structured loop: with no signal declared, nothing matches prose |
| `max_iterations` | Yes | number | Maximum iterations before the node fails |
| `fresh_context` | No | boolean | Start a new session each iteration (default: false) |
| `until_bash` | One channel required | string | Shell script run after each iteration; exit 0 signals completion. Skipped once a cheaper channel already fired |
| `until_field` | One channel required | string | **`loop:` only.** Names a boolean in the node's `output_format`; the loop ends when its validated value is `true` |
| `interactive` | No | boolean | Pause at a human gate after each iteration for input via `/workflow approve` |
| `gate_message` | No | string | Message shown at the interactive gate (required when `interactive: true`) |
| `signal_completes` | No | boolean | Interactive loops only: a detected completion signal completes the node immediately (even on iteration 1) instead of gating (default: false) |

**Example:**

```yaml
- id: refine
  loop:
    prompt: "Review the current draft and improve it. Output COMPLETE when done."
    until: "COMPLETE"
    max_iterations: 5
```

### Loop Group Options

Defined under `loop_group:` inside a node — repeats a sealed multi-node sub-DAG
per iteration (see [Cross-Node Loops](/guides/loop-nodes/#cross-node-loops-with-loop_group)):

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `nodes` | Yes | node[] | Sub-DAG body re-run in full each iteration. Executable nodes, `include:`, and nested `loop_group` are supported; runtime `workflow:` sub-runs are not. `depends_on` is body-scoped; body ids must not shadow outer ids |
| `until` | One channel required | string | Completion signal — checked in the body's terminal-node output. Omit it for a deterministic group |
| `max_iterations` | Yes | number | Maximum iterations before the node fails |
| `fresh_context` | No | boolean | `true` starts fresh body AI sessions each iteration (default: false — sessions continue) |
| `until_bash` | One channel required | string | Shell script run after each iteration; exit 0 signals completion. Skipped once a cheaper channel already fired |
| `interactive` | No | boolean | Pause at a human gate after each non-completing iteration |
| `gate_message` | No | string | Message shown at the interactive gate |
| `signal_completes` | No | boolean | Interactive loops only: a detected completion signal completes the group immediately (even on iteration 1) instead of gating (default: false) |

Body nodes can reference the previous iteration via
`$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output`, and outer-DAG outputs via plain `$nodeId.output`.
`retry` is rejected on `loop_group` nodes; `model`/`provider` set on the group
become defaults for body AI nodes.

**Example:**

```yaml
- id: fix-loop
  loop_group:
    until: TESTS_PASS
    max_iterations: 5
    nodes:
      - id: implement
        prompt: "Fix the failing tests. Previous run: $LOOP_PREV.test.output"
      - id: test
        bash: bun test
        depends_on: [implement]
```

### Retry Options

Defined under `retry:` inside a node:

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_attempts` | Yes | — | Retry attempts after the initial failure (max: 5) |
| `delay_ms` | No | 3000 | Initial delay in milliseconds; doubles each attempt (1000-60000) |
| `on_error` | No | `transient` | `transient` retries rate limits/network errors; `all` retries everything except fatal errors |

> **Fatal errors are never retried**: auth failures, permission errors, and exhausted credit balances fail immediately regardless of retry config.

## Hook Schema

Hooks are defined per-node under `hooks:`. See [Chapter 9](/book/hooks-and-quality/) for full examples.

```yaml
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Write|Edit"    # Regex against tool name. Omit to match all.
      timeout: 60              # Seconds. Default: 60.
      response:
        hookSpecificOutput:
          hookEventName: PreToolUse
          additionalContext: "Verify the file before writing"
          permissionDecision: deny    # allow | deny | ask
          permissionDecisionReason: "Not allowed in this node"
          updatedInput:               # Override tool arguments
            file_path: "/sandbox/out.ts"
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Read"
      response:
        hookSpecificOutput:
          hookEventName: PostToolUse
          additionalContext: "This file is read-only. Do not modify it."
```

| Hook Event | When it fires |
|------------|--------------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool executes |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool completes successfully |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After a tool fails |
| `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` | On session lifecycle events |
| `Stop` | When the agent stops |

## Directory Structure

### `~/.archon/` (user-level)

```
~/.archon/
├── config.yaml                        # Global configuration (non-secrets)
├── archon.db                          # SQLite database (default; no DATABASE_URL needed)
└── workspaces/

            └── logs/                  # Workflow execution logs (JSONL)
```

### `.archon/` (repo-level)

```
.archon/
├── config.yaml                        # Repo-specific configuration
├── commands/                          # Custom command files (*.md)

└── workflows/                         # Custom workflow files (*.yaml)
    └── my-workflow.yaml
```

**Bundled defaults** — built-in commands and workflows ship with Archon and load automatically. Repo-level files with the same name override the bundled version. To disable defaults entirely:

```yaml
# .archon/config.yaml
defaults:
  loadDefaultCommands: false
  loadDefaultWorkflows: false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

| Error | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| `Workflow "X" not found` | YAML file not discovered | Check file is in `.archon/workflows/` and `archon workflow list` shows it |
| `Command "X" not found` | Command file missing | For a packaged workflow, check its own `commands/X.md` and run `archon validate workflows <name>`; otherwise check the shared command path and run `archon validate commands X` |
| `Routing unclear — falling back to archon-assist` | No workflow matched the input | Use an explicit workflow name: `archon workflow run my-workflow "..."` |
| `Worktree already exists for branch X` | Prior run left a worktree | Run `archon complete X` or `archon isolation cleanup` |
| `Not a git repository` | Running outside a repo | `cd` into a git repo first — workflow and isolation commands require one |
| `Unknown provider 'X'. Registered: claude, codex, pi` | Typo in `provider:` (workflow root or node-level) | Set `provider:` to one of the registered ids. Model strings themselves are not validated at load time — the SDK rejects unknown models at request time. |
| `$BASE_BRANCH referenced but could not be detected` | No base branch set and auto-detection failed | Set `worktree.baseBranch` in `.archon/config.yaml` or ensure `main`/`master` exists |
| Node fails with "timed out with no output" | `idle_timeout` fired before the provider emitted anything (time-to-first-token exceeded the window) | Increase `idle_timeout` on the node or reduce prompt size |

### Debug Techniques

**See what Archon found:**
```bash
archon workflow list          # Are your workflows loaded?
archon validate workflows     # Any YAML errors?
archon isolation list         # Any stale worktrees?
```

**Enable verbose logging:**
```bash
archon --verbose workflow run my-workflow "..."
```

**Check execution logs** — each run writes a JSONL log:
```
~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/logs/
```

**Run without isolation** to simplify debugging:
```bash
archon workflow run my-workflow --no-worktree "..."
```

**Test a command directly** before embedding it in a workflow:
```bash
archon workflow run archon-assist "/command-invoke my-command some-arg"
```

### Getting Help

- **Validate your YAML**: `archon validate workflows my-workflow`
- **Check the logs**: `~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/logs/`
- **Report issues**: [github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues)
