/**
 * Load-time workflow inlining (`include:`) — the deterministic expansion engine.
 *
 * After discovery has assembled the full name→workflow map (bundled < global <
 * project precedence already applied), this module walks every workflow and
 * replaces each `include: <target>` node with the target workflow's nodes,
 * inlined as a flattened, namespaced sub-DAG:
 *
 *   - each included node `n` becomes a top-level node with id `<includeId>__<n.id>`
 *   - the included nodes' internal `depends_on` and `$id.output` refs are rewired
 *     to the namespaced ids
 *   - the include node's own `depends_on`/`when`/`trigger_rule` attach to the
 *     sub-DAG's ENTRY nodes (those with no internal upstream)
 *   - other parent nodes that referenced the include id resolve `depends_on: [I]`
 *     to the sub-DAG's SINKS and `$I.output` to its PRIMARY sink. The primary sink is
 *     the block's declared `returns:` node when it sets one (#2470) — which may be a
 *     NON-sink node — otherwise the first sink in definition order. `returns:` moves
 *     ONLY the primary sink; `depends_on: [I]` still waits on every sink. (loop_group's
 *     own first-sink terminal rule is deliberately unchanged.)
 *
 * Targets are resolved recursively (a target may itself `include:` others),
 * depth-capped and cycle-detected. Because expansion runs BEFORE any
 * WorkflowDefinition reaches the executor, the executor receives a flat DAG with no
 * include nodes. Included command-backed loops additionally carry symbol-keyed compiled
 * prompt/error metadata so a resumed run can prefer its persisted prompt snapshot even
 * when the source command has disappeared. Every execution path re-discovers → re-expands
 * deterministically, so resume matches the persisted namespaced step names byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Delimiter note: the namespace joiner is `__` (double underscore), NOT `.`. The
 * output-ref substitution regex forbids dots in a node id, so a dotted id would
 * silently break every rewritten `$id.output` reference. `__` is inside the legal
 * id character class, so `$review__scope.output` substitutes correctly.
