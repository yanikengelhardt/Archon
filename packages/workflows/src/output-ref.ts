/**
 * Strict resolution for `$nodeId.output.field` references (no-silent-drop).
 *
 * Shared by both consumers — prompt/script substitution (`substituteNodeOutputRefs`
 * in dag-executor) and `when:` evaluation (`resolveOutputRef` in condition-evaluator)
 * — so the contract is identical in both.
 *
 * Resolution table for a known producer:
 *   1. Producer HAS `declaredFields` (an `output_format` with `properties`) — enforce it:
 *        field ∈ declaredFields, value present      → value
 *        field ∈ declaredFields, value absent/null  → '' (declared-optional / explicit null)
 *        field ∉ declaredFields                      → THROW (typo / not in the contract)
 *        output is not a JSON object at all          → THROW (#2456 — a declared schema is
 *                                                      never quieter than no schema; the
 *                                                      leniency above covers a missing KEY
 *                                                      in a parsed object, not a missing object)
 *
 *   Either THROW-on-unparseable above reports reason 'truncated' instead of
 *   'unparseable' when the output carries the persistence truncation marker — same
 *   parse failure, but the producer was right and a resumed run is reading a clipped
 *   copy, so the author needs opposite advice. See utils/output-truncation.ts.
 *   2. Has a `structuredOutput` object but NO `declaredFields` (legacy rows, or a
 *      non-object schema) — prefer it, but stay LENIENT: with no declared schema we
 *      can't tell optional-absent from a typo, so:
 *        key present → value ;  key absent → '' (no throw — backward compatible)
 *   3. Schemaless (bash/script/prose) — the author wrote `.field`, so JSON with that
 *      key is expected; anything else is a drop they must see:
 *        output not a JSON object → THROW ;  key present → value ;  key absent → THROW
 *
 * The whole-text `$node.output` form (no `.field`) is never routed here — it is
 * unchanged and never throws.
 *
 * The UNKNOWN-node case (`$typo.output.field` where nothing in the outputs map
 * resolves — a typo, or a real node that has not run before the reference) is
 * handled by the callers, not `resolveNodeOutputField` — they own the outputs map.
 * A `.field` ref to such an id throws `OutputRefError('unknown-node')` there, so it
 * fails the consuming node loudly, consistent with the strict field posture above;
 * a whole-text `$typo.output` to an unresolved id stays lenient ('') as a
 * long-documented surface. See `similarNodeIds`.
