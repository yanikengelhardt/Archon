 * behaving like its own file's node instead of the composing parent's:
 *
 *  - `origin` — the authoring workflow's name. Write-once (innermost wins), so a
 *    node nested three files deep still names the file that declared it.
 *  - `inputs` — that workflow's contract-resolved `inputs:` (defaults applied),
 *    delivered to its `bash:`/`script:` nodes as `INPUTS_<UPPER_SNAKE>` env vars.
 *    Write-once for the same reason, and because input names carry no namespace:
 *    two levels both declaring `plan` have no disambiguator, so the inner one wins.
 *  - `blockEntry` — this node starts its block. The executor clears the sequential
 *    session cursor there so a composed workflow begins as coldly as it would
 *    standalone.
 *  - `boundaries` — caller-level activation predicates for enclosing include instances,
 *    outermost first. Non-entry descendants enforce them before their local trigger rule.
