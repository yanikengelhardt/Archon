/**
 * Per-child isolation resolver port for `workflow:` sub-run nodes (#2121 slice 2,
 * PR-A).
 *
 * A STRUCTURAL port — the exact analogue of the container write-back port in
 * `./container-context.ts`. It lives in `@archon/workflows` and imports ONLY local
 * types (no `@archon/isolation`), so the engine can drive per-child worktree
 * creation without depending on that package. The IMPLEMENTATION is constructed by
 * the caller (CLI / orchestrator, via `@archon/core`) over `WorktreeProvider` and
 * injected through {@link ExecuteWorkflowOptions.resolveChildIsolation}.
 *
 * The one real departure from the container precedent: the container backend is
 * resolved ONCE in the caller before `executeWorkflow` and passed in as a
 * pre-built context. Per-child isolation cannot be — the child count is a RUNTIME
 * property (fan-out, PR-C) and children spawn deep inside the DAG — so the port is
 * a RESOLVER the engine calls once per child at spawn time.
