## Project Overview

**Archon — a self-hostable, governed agentic automation engine.** Archon runs multi-step workflows that mix deterministic steps (bash/scripts) with AI agents (Claude Code SDK, Codex SDK, and others), with human approval gates and full audit trails — driven remotely from Slack, Telegram, GitHub, Discord, the web UI, or the CLI. Its most mature surface today is agentic **coding** (controlling Claude Code / Codex against repos); the same engine is being extended to drive general **business-operations** automation. Built with **Bun + TypeScript + SQLite/PostgreSQL** and deployed as a single-tenant install (one isolated instance per operator or client — see *Single-Tenant per Install*). Architecture prioritizes simplicity, flexibility, governance, and user control.

## Product Direction

Archon is being positioned as a governed agentic automation engine for business operations, not only coding.

## Core Principles

**Single-Tenant per Install**
- One isolated instance per operator or client — the deployment model is one install (e.g. one VPS) per client, **not** one install serving many tenants. Keep the data model and runtime single-tenant: no per-tenant isolation, row-scoping, or tenant multiplexing. Client isolation is achieved at the **deployment** layer, not in code — a deliberate simplification, not a limitation.
- Multi-**user** within one install (several humans sharing an instance, each with their own identity and credentials) **is** supported, and is distinct from multi-**tenant**. Don't conflate them.

**Platform Agnostic**
- Unified conversation interface across Slack/Telegram/GitHub/cli/web
- Platform adapters implement `IPlatformAdapter`
- Stream/batch AI responses in real-time to all platforms

**Type Safety (CRITICAL)**
- Strict TypeScript configuration enforced
- All functions must have complete type annotations
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Interfaces for all major abstractions

**Zod Schema Conventions**
- Schema naming: camelCase, descriptive suffix (e.g., `workflowRunSchema`, `errorSchema`)
- Type derivation: always use `z.infer<typeof schema>` — never write parallel hand-crafted interfaces
- Import `z` from `@hono/zod-openapi` (not from `zod` directly). Exception: `@archon/providers` imports `z` from `zod` directly in `claude/native-tools.ts` — it only builds the Zod shape the Claude SDK's `tool()` expects (never an OpenAPI schema), and being an SDK-deps-only leaf package it must not pull in Hono.
- Recursive schemas: use zod v4 getter properties plus an explicit `z.ZodType<T>` annotation with a hand-written `T` to break the inference cycle — the annotation forces structural agreement so drift is a compile error. Established precedent: `loopGroupNodeConfigSchema`/`LoopGroupNodeConfig` in `packages/workflows/src/schemas/dag-node.ts` (the one sanctioned exception to the z.infer-only rule)
- Record schemas: always pass an explicit key type — `z.record(z.string(), valueSchema)` — zod v4 dropped the single-arg `z.record(valueSchema)` form
- All new/modified API routes must use `registerOpenApiRoute(createRoute({...}), handler)` — the local wrapper handles the TypedResponse bypass. Two narrow exceptions exist: (1) routes that serve raw non-JSON content (e.g. `/api/artifacts/:runId/*` returns `text/markdown`/`text/plain`) AND use wildcard path params that OpenAPI 3.0 can't represent, use `app.get(...)` with an explanatory comment; (2) multipart-or-JSON routes (e.g. `/api/conversations/:id/message`, `/api/workflows/:name/run`) register through `registerOpenApiRoute` but drop `request.body` from the route config so Zod doesn't validate multipart payloads against a JSON schema — the handler parses both content types manually.
- Core row schemas live in `packages/core/src/schemas/` — one file per data shape (conversation, message, user, codebase, session, workflow-event, env-var, workflow-run); `index.ts` re-exports all
- Route schemas live in `packages/server/src/routes/schemas/` — one file per domain
- Engine schemas live in `packages/workflows/src/schemas/` — one file per concern (dag-node, workflow, workflow-run, retry, loop, hooks, node-artifact); `index.ts` re-exports all
- Engine schema naming: camelCase (e.g., `dagNodeSchema`, `workflowBaseSchema`, `nodeOutputSchema`)
- `TRIGGER_RULES` and `WORKFLOW_HOOK_EVENTS` are derived from schema `.options` — never duplicate as a plain array (exception: `@archon/web` must define a local constant since `api.generated.d.ts` is type-only and cannot export runtime values)
- `loader.ts` uses `dagNodeSchema.safeParse()` for node validation; graph-level checks (cycles, deps, `$nodeId.output` refs) remain as imperative code in `validateDagStructure()`

**Git Workflow and Releases**
- `main` is the release branch. Never commit directly to `main`.
- `dev` is the working branch. All feature work branches off `dev` and merges back into `dev`.
- All PRs must use the template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — fill in every section. When opening a PR via `gh pr create`, copy the template into the body explicitly; GitHub only auto-applies it through the web UI.
- Link the issue with `Closes #<number>` (or `Fixes` / `Resolves`) in the PR description so it auto-closes on merge.
- To release, use the `/release` skill. It compares `dev` to `main`, generates changelog entries, bumps the version, and creates a PR to merge `dev` into `main`.
- Releases follow Semantic Versioning: `/release` (patch), `/release minor`, `/release major`.
- Changelog lives in `CHANGELOG.md` and follows Keep a Changelog format.
- Version is the single `version` field in the root `package.json`.

**Git as First-Class Citizen**
- Let git handle what git does best (conflicts, uncommitted changes, branch management)
- Surface git errors to users for actionable issues (conflicts, uncommitted changes)
- Handle expected failure cases gracefully (missing directories during cleanup)
- Trust git's natural guardrails (e.g., refuse to remove worktree with uncommitted changes)
- Use `@archon/git` functions for git operations; use `execFileAsync` (not `exec`) when calling git directly
- Worktrees enable parallel development per conversation without branch conflicts
- Workspace sync is non-destructive by default: fetch, classify state, and fast-forward only when safe
- Use explicit `mode: 'reset'` only for Archon-owned checkout paths where the caller intentionally wants to hard-reset to `origin/<branch>` before creating a managed worktree
- **NEVER run `git clean -fd`** - it permanently deletes untracked files (use `git checkout .` instead)

## Engineering Principles

These are implementation constraints, not slogans. Apply them by default.

**KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid**
- Prefer straightforward control flow over clever meta-programming
- Prefer explicit branches and typed interfaces over hidden dynamic behavior
- Keep error paths obvious and localized

**YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It**
- Do not add config keys, interface methods, feature flags, or workflow branches without a concrete accepted use case
- Do not introduce speculative abstractions without at least one current caller
- Keep unsupported paths explicit (error out) rather than adding partial fake support

**DRY + Rule of Three**
- Duplicate small, local logic when it preserves clarity
- Extract shared utilities only after the same pattern appears at least three times and has stabilized
- When extracting, preserve module boundaries and avoid hidden coupling

**SRP + ISP — Single Responsibility + Interface Segregation**
- Keep each module and package focused on one concern
- Extend behavior by implementing existing narrow interfaces (`IPlatformAdapter`, `IAgentProvider`, `IDatabase`, `IWorkflowStore`) whenever possible
- Avoid fat interfaces and "god modules" that mix policy, transport, and storage
- Do not add unrelated methods to an existing interface — define a new one

**Fail Fast + Explicit Errors** — Silent fallback in agent runtimes can create unsafe or costly behavior
- Prefer throwing early with a clear error for unsupported or unsafe states — never silently swallow errors
- Never silently broaden permissions or capabilities
- Document fallback behavior with a comment when a fallback is intentional and safe; otherwise throw

**No Autonomous Lifecycle Mutation Across Process Boundaries**
- When a process cannot reliably distinguish "actively running elsewhere" from "orphaned by a crash" — typically because the work was started by a different process or input source (CLI, adapter, webhook, web UI, cron) — it must not autonomously mark that work as failed/cancelled/abandoned based on a timer or staleness guess.
- Surface the ambiguous state to the user and provide a one-click action.
- Heuristics for *recoverable* operations (retry backoff, subprocess timeouts, hygiene cleanup of terminal-status data) remain appropriate; the rule is about destructive mutation of *non-terminal* state owned by an unknowable other party.
- Reference: #1216 and the CLI orphan-cleanup precedent at `packages/cli/src/cli.ts:256-258`.

**Determinism + Reproducibility**
- Prefer reproducible commands and locked dependency behavior in CI-sensitive paths
- Keep tests deterministic — no flaky timing or network dependence without guardrails
- Ensure local validation commands (`bun run validate`) map directly to CI expectations

**Reversibility + Rollback-First Thinking**
- Keep changes easy to revert: small scope, clear blast radius
- For risky changes, define the rollback path before merging
- Avoid mixed mega-patches that block safe rollback

## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start server + Web UI together (hot reload for both)
bun run dev

# Or start individually
bun run dev:server  # Backend only (port 3090)
bun run dev:web     # Frontend only (port 5173)
```

Regenerating frontend API types (requires server to be running at port 3090):

```bash
bun run dev:server  # must be running first
bun --filter @archon/web generate:types
```

Optional: Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite by setting `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`:

```bash
docker-compose --profile with-db up -d postgres
# Set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/remote_coding_agent in .env
```

### Testing

```bash
bun run test                # Run all tests (per-package, isolated processes)
bun test --watch            # Watch mode (single package)
bun test packages/core/src/handlers/command-handler.test.ts  # Single file
```

**Test isolation (mock.module pollution):** Bun's `mock.module()` permanently replaces modules in the process-wide cache — `mock.restore()` does NOT undo it ([oven-sh/bun#7823](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/7823)). To prevent cross-file pollution, packages that have conflicting `mock.module()` calls split their tests into separate `bun test` invocations: `@archon/core` (20 batches), `@archon/workflows` (5), `@archon/adapters` (6), `@archon/isolation` (3). See each package's `package.json` for the exact splits.

**Do NOT run `bun test` from the repo root** — it discovers all test files across all packages and runs them in one process, causing ~135 mock pollution failures. Always use `bun run test` (which uses `bun --filter '*' test` for per-package isolation).

### Type Checking & Linting

```bash
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix
bun run format
bun run format:check
```

### Pre-PR Validation

**Always run before creating a pull request:**

```bash
bun run validate
```

This runs `check:bundled`, `check:bundled-skill`, `check:bundled-schema`, `check:pi-vendor-map`, type-check, lint, format check, and tests. All eight must pass for CI to succeed.

### ESLint Guidelines

**Zero-tolerance policy**: CI enforces `--max-warnings 0`. No warnings allowed.

**When to use inline disable comments** (`// eslint-disable-next-line`):
- **Almost never** - fix the issue instead
- Only acceptable when:
  1. External SDK types are incorrect (document which SDK and why)
  2. Intentional type assertion after validation (must include comment explaining the validation)

**Never acceptable:**
- Disabling `no-explicit-any` without justification
- Disabling rules to "make CI pass"
- Bulk disabling at file level (`/* eslint-disable */`)

### Database

**Auto-Detection (SQLite is the default — zero setup):**
- **Without `DATABASE_URL`**: Uses SQLite at `~/.archon/archon.db` (auto-initialized, recommended for most users)
- **With `DATABASE_URL` set**: Uses PostgreSQL (schema auto-applied on startup; no manual `psql` needed). The Postgres adapter runs the idempotent `migrations/000_combined.sql` inside an advisory-lock transaction on first connection, so upgrades that add tables or columns converge automatically.

### CLI (Command Line)

Run workflows directly from the command line without needing the server. Workflow and isolation commands require running from within a git repository (subdirectories work - resolves to repo root).

```bash
# List available workflows (requires git repo)
bun run cli workflow list

# Machine-readable JSON output
bun run cli workflow list --json

# Run a workflow
bun run cli workflow run assist "What does the orchestrator do?"

# Run in a specific directory
bun run cli workflow run plan --cwd /path/to/repo "Add dark mode"

# Default: auto-creates worktree with generated branch name (isolation by default)
bun run cli workflow run implement "Add auth"

# Explicit branch name for the worktree
bun run cli workflow run implement --branch feature-auth "Add auth"

# Opt out of isolation (run in live checkout)
bun run cli workflow run quick-fix --no-worktree "Fix typo"

# Register the current non-git directory as a folder project and run in place (no worktree)
bun run cli workflow run assist --folder "List every repo under this multi-repo root"

# Run in a detached background child (returns immediately; find it via `workflow runs`)
bun run cli workflow run implement "Add auth" --detach

# Show active runs (running + paused)
bun run cli workflow status

# List recent runs of ALL statuses, scoped to this project's codebase (cwd)
bun run cli workflow runs
bun run cli workflow runs --json                 # machine-readable { runs, total, counts }
bun run cli workflow runs --status failed --limit 50
bun run cli workflow runs --all                  # across all projects

# Show detail for one run (any status); --verbose adds per-node summary
bun run cli workflow get <run-id>
bun run cli workflow get <run-id> --json

# Resume a failed workflow (re-runs, skipping completed nodes)
bun run cli workflow resume <run-id>

# Discard a non-terminal run
bun run cli workflow abandon <run-id>

# Most read/write subcommands accept --json for machine-readable output:
#   list, status, runs, get, approve, reject, abandon, resume.
# For approve/reject/resume, --json records/validates the decision and returns a
# clean JSON line WITHOUT the inline auto-resume (drive continuation separately).

# Delete old workflow run records (default: 7 days)
bun run cli workflow cleanup
bun run cli workflow cleanup 30  # Custom days

# Clear persisted per-node AI sessions for a workflow (persist_session memory)
# Without --scope, wipes every scope and requires --yes; --node narrows to one node
bun run cli workflow reset-sessions <workflow-name> [--scope <key>] [--node <id>] [--yes] [--json]

# Emit a workflow event (used inside workflow loop prompts)
bun run cli workflow event emit --run-id <uuid> --type <event-type> [--data <json>]

# List active worktrees/environments
bun run cli isolation list

# Clean up stale environments (default: 7 days)
bun run cli isolation cleanup
bun run cli isolation cleanup 14  # Custom days

# Clean up environments with branches merged into main (also deletes remote branches)
bun run cli isolation cleanup --merged

# Also remove environments with closed (abandoned) PRs
bun run cli isolation cleanup --merged --include-closed

# Validate workflow definitions and their referenced resources
bun run cli validate workflows              # All workflows
bun run cli validate workflows my-workflow  # Single workflow
bun run cli validate workflows my-workflow --json  # Machine-readable output

# Validate command files
bun run cli validate commands               # All commands
bun run cli validate commands my-command    # Single command

# Complete branch lifecycle (remove worktree + local/remote branches)
bun run cli complete <branch-name>
bun run cli complete <branch-name> --force  # Skip uncommitted-changes check

# Start the web UI server (compiled binary only, downloads web UI on first run)
bun run cli serve
bun run cli serve --port 4000
bun run cli serve --download-only  # Download without starting

# Install the bundled Archon skill into a project
bun run cli skill install
bun run cli skill install /path/to/project

# Verify your Archon setup (Claude binary, gh auth, DB, adapters)
bun run cli doctor

# Connect your GitHub identity via device flow (multi-user installs only:
# App mode + TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY). Identity from ARCHON_USER_ID or $USER.
bun run cli auth github

# Manage per-user AI-provider credentials (any install — vault auto-provisioned; TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY overrides the local key on managed deploys).
# Identity from ARCHON_USER_ID or $USER. The key is read from a masked prompt or
# piped stdin — never from argv.
bun run cli ai key set <vendor>            # connect an API key by VENDOR id (e.g. openrouter, anthropic, openai;
                                           # legacy claude/codex/copilot accepted and normalized — #1955)
echo "$MY_KEY" | bun run cli ai key set openrouter
bun run cli ai login <vendor>              # connect a SUBSCRIPTION (anthropic/openai/github-copilot) via OAuth — openai/ChatGPT uses Archon's own PKCE flow (#1924)
bun run cli ai list                        # list connected providers (no secrets)
bun run cli ai logout <vendor>             # disconnect a credential

# Model tiers + aliases + default assistant (install-wide config; works on solo
# installs — these write ~/.archon/config.yaml and need NO TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY).
# Full parity with the console "AI Settings" → Model Tiers / Aliases / Defaults
# sections. `--scope user` (Phase 3) instead writes the caller's per-user prefs
# row (remote_agent_user_ai_prefs, identity from ARCHON_USER_ID/$USER) — the
# highest-precedence resolver layer for that user's runs and chats.
bun run cli ai tier set <tier> <provider> <model> [--effort <e>] [--scope user|install]
bun run cli ai tier list [--json]          # show configured tiers (install + yours) vs built-in defaults
bun run cli ai tier unset <tier> [--scope user|install]
bun run cli ai alias set <@name> <provider> <model> [--effort <e>] [--scope user|install]
bun run cli ai alias list [--json]         # show @custom aliases (install + yours)
bun run cli ai alias unset <@name> [--scope user|install]
bun run cli ai default <provider> [<model>] [--scope user|install]   # set the default assistant (+ optional chat model; user scope writes provider+model atomically, install scope writes assistants.<p>.model)

# Inspect or rotate the anonymous telemetry install UUID
bun run cli telemetry status
bun run cli telemetry reset

# Show version
bun run cli version
```

**Import Patterns:**

**IMPORTANT**: Always use typed imports - never use generic `import *` for the main package.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Use `import type` for type-only imports
import type { IPlatformAdapter, Conversation, MergedConfig } from '@archon/core';

// ✅ CORRECT: Use specific named imports for values
import { handleMessage, ConversationLockManager, pool } from '@archon/core';

// ✅ CORRECT: Namespace imports for submodules with many exports
import * as conversationDb from '@archon/core/db/conversations';
import * as git from '@archon/git';

// ✅ CORRECT: Import workflow engine types/functions from direct subpaths
import type { WorkflowDeps } from '@archon/workflows/deps';
import type { IWorkflowStore } from '@archon/workflows/store';
import type { WorkflowDefinition } from '@archon/workflows/schemas/workflow';
import { executeWorkflow } from '@archon/workflows/executor';
import { discoverWorkflowsWithConfig } from '@archon/workflows/workflow-discovery';
import { findWorkflow } from '@archon/workflows/router';

// ❌ WRONG: Never use generic import for main package

```

### Database Schema

**18 Tables (all prefixed with `remote_agent_`):**
1. **`codebases`** - Repository/project metadata and commands (JSONB); `kind` (`'repo'`/`'folder'`, default `'repo'`) discriminates git repos from **folder projects** (non-git workspaces — multi-repo roots or plain ops folders — that run in place with named `_folder/<slug>/` storage; `repository_url`/`default_branch` are null)
2. **`conversations`** - Track platform conversations with titles and soft-delete support; nullable `user_id` records first creator (provenance + execution-identity **fallback** only — chat turns execute as the message sender, #1982)
3. **`sessions`** - Track AI SDK sessions with resume capability
4. **`isolation_environments`** - Git worktree isolation tracking; nullable `created_by_user_id` preserves first creator
5. **`workflow_runs`** - Workflow execution tracking and state; nullable `user_id` for per-run attribution
6. **`workflow_events`** - Step-level workflow event log (step transitions, artifacts, errors)
7. **`messages`** - Conversation message history with tool call metadata (JSONB); nullable `user_id` (NULL for assistant rows). Split write-path: the **web** adapter persists its own turns via `MessagePersistence`; the **orchestrator** persists non-web turns (Slack/Telegram/GitHub/Discord/CLI) fire-and-forget, guarded by `isWebAdapter` to avoid double-writing web turns — only AI-bound turns get a user row (deterministic-command and approval-only turns return earlier), so a `user` row always pairs with an `assistant` row
8. **`codebase_env_vars`** - Per-project env vars injected into project-scoped execution surfaces (Claude, Codex, bash/script nodes, and direct chat when codebase-scoped), managed via Web UI or `env:` in config
9. **`users`** - Archon-internal identity (one row per human/bot); created lazily on first sight by any adapter; `role` (`'admin'`(default)`/'member'`) is the identity seam for future per-resource scoping (visibility stays open today)
10. **`user_identities`** - Per-platform mapping (Slack U-id, Telegram chat id, Discord snowflake, GitHub login, Better Auth web user id) → `users.id`; `UNIQUE(platform, platform_user_id)`
11. **`workflow_node_sessions`** - Per-node provider session IDs persisted across workflow re-runs (opt-in via `persist_session`); keyed by `(workflow_name, node_id, scope_key, provider)`; `scope_key` is typically the conversation UUID
12. **`user_github_tokens`** - Per-user GitHub device-flow tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM); one row per Archon user (`UNIQUE(user_id)`), cascades on user deletion; numeric `github_user_id` anchors the commit no-reply email
13. **`user_provider_keys`** - Per-user AI-provider credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM); one row per `(user_id, provider)` (`UNIQUE(user_id, provider)`), cascades on user deletion; `kind` is `api_key` or `oauth`; resolved + injected into the **acting user's** (run starter / message sender) runs/chat env at execution time. Always available — the encryption key is auto-provisioned at `~/.archon/credential-key` when `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not set. Since #1955 the `provider` column holds **vendor-canonical credential ids** (`anthropic`, `openai`, `github-copilot`, plus the Pi backend vendors) — NOT agent ids; legacy `claude`/`codex`/`copilot` rows are renamed by an idempotent startup data fix (vendor row wins on conflict), and the connectable catalog is derived from provider registrations (`acceptedCredentials` via `credentials:` on `ProviderRegistration`), never hand-listed
14. **`user_ai_prefs`** - Per-user AI preferences (Phase 3): personal model `tiers`/`aliases` (JSON-as-TEXT) + `default_provider` + `default_model` (#1998 — per-user default CHAT model, written atomically with `default_provider`; replaces the `large`-tier lookup for direct chat only when the effective provider matches — workflows still resolve `large`). NON-encrypted (model names aren't secrets — mirrors `codebase_env_vars`, not the provider-key store); one row per user (`UNIQUE(user_id)`), cascades on user deletion. Folded into `buildAiProfile` as the highest-precedence layer at the userId-aware seams (workflow executor: run starter; chat orchestrator: message **sender**-first, conversation creator only as fallback — #1982); needs a web/CLI identity but NO `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
15–18. **`remote_agent_auth_user` / `remote_agent_auth_session` / `remote_agent_auth_account` / `remote_agent_auth_verification`** - Better Auth tables for opt-in web login (**PostgreSQL only**; always created on Postgres via the idempotent schema apply, but populated only when web auth is enabled — `DATABASE_URL` + `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`). Owned and shaped by Better Auth (text ids, camelCase columns); Archon never queries them directly — a session maps to the canonical `users` row via `user_identities('web', <betterAuthUserId>)`

**Key Patterns:**
- Conversation ID format: Platform-specific (`thread_ts`, `chat_id`, `user/repo#123`)
- One active session per conversation
- Codebase commands stored in filesystem, paths in `codebases.commands` JSONB

**Session Transitions:**
- Sessions are immutable - transitions create new linked sessions
- Each transition has explicit `TransitionTrigger` reason (first-message, plan-to-execute, reset-requested, etc.)
- Audit trail: `parent_session_id` links to previous session, `transition_reason` records why
- Only plan→execute creates new session immediately; other triggers deactivate current session

### Architecture Layers

**Package Split:**
- **@archon/paths**: Path resolution utilities, Pino logger factory, web dist cache path (`getWebDistDir`), CWD env stripper (`stripCwdEnv`, `strip-cwd-env-boot`) (no @archon/* deps; `pino` and `dotenv` are allowed external deps)
- **@archon/git**: Git operations - worktrees, branches, repos, exec wrappers (depends only on @archon/paths)
- **@archon/providers**: AI agent providers (Claude, Codex, Pi community) — owns SDK deps, `IAgentProvider` interface, `sendQuery()` contract, and provider-specific option translation. `@archon/providers/types` is the contract subpath (zero SDK deps, zero runtime side effects) that `@archon/workflows` imports from. Providers receive raw `nodeConfig` + `assistantConfig` and translate to SDK-specific options internally. Core providers live under `claude/` and `codex/`; community providers live under `community/` (currently `community/pi/`, registered with `builtIn: false`). `@archon/providers/oauth` is the SDK-boundary subpath wrapping Pi's `@earendil-works/pi-ai/oauth` (subscription login: Claude Pro/Max, Copilot) — `@archon/core` drives Pi-based subscription OAuth through it so the Pi SDK dep stays in `@archon/providers`. The ChatGPT/Codex subscription login is NOT Pi-driven: it's Archon-owned PKCE in `@archon/core` `credentials/openai-oauth.ts` (Pi drops the `id_token` the Codex CLI requires, #1924).
- **@archon/isolation**: Worktree isolation types, providers, resolver, error classifiers (depends only on @archon/git + @archon/paths)
- **@archon/workflows**: Workflow engine - loader, router, executor, DAG, logger, bundled defaults (depends only on @archon/git + @archon/paths + @archon/providers/types + @hono/zod-openapi + zod; DB/AI/config injected via `WorkflowDeps`)
- **@archon/cli**: Command-line interface for running workflows and starting the web UI server (depends on @archon/server + @archon/adapters for the serve command)
- **@archon/core**: Business logic, database, orchestration (depends on @archon/providers for AI and @hono/zod-openapi for core Zod schemas; provides `createWorkflowStore()` adapter bridging core DB → `IWorkflowStore`)
- **@archon/adapters**: Platform adapters for Slack, Telegram, GitHub, Discord (depends on @archon/core)
- **@archon/server**: OpenAPIHono HTTP server (Zod + OpenAPI spec generation via `@hono/zod-openapi`), Web adapter (SSE), API routes, Web UI static serving (depends on @archon/adapters)
- **@archon/web**: React frontend (Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + Zustand), SSE streaming to server. `WorkflowRunStatus`, `WorkflowDefinition`, and `DagNode` are all derived from `src/lib/api.generated.d.ts` (generated from the OpenAPI spec via `bun generate:types`; never import from `@archon/workflows`)

**1. Platform Adapters**
- Implement `IPlatformAdapter` interface
- Handle platform-specific message formats
- **Web** (`packages/server/src/adapters/web/`): Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming, conversation ID = user-provided string
- **Slack** (`packages/adapters/src/chat/slack/`): SDK with polling (not webhooks), conversation ID = `thread_ts`
- **Telegram** (`packages/adapters/src/chat/telegram/`): Bot API with polling, conversation ID = `chat_id`
- **GitHub** (`packages/adapters/src/forge/github/`): Webhooks + GitHub CLI, conversation ID = `owner/repo#number`
- **Discord** (`packages/adapters/src/community/chat/discord/`): discord.js WebSocket, conversation ID = channel ID

**Adapter Authorization Pattern:**
- Auth checks happen INSIDE adapters (encapsulation, consistency)
- Auth utilities co-located with each adapter (e.g., `packages/adapters/src/chat/slack/auth.ts`)
- Parse whitelist from env var in constructor (e.g., `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`)
- Check authorization in message handler (before calling `onMessage` callback)
- Silent rejection for unauthorized users (no error response)
- Log unauthorized attempts with masked user IDs for privacy
- Adapters expose `onMessage(handler)` callback; errors handled by caller

**2. Command Handler** (`packages/core/src/handlers/`)
- Process slash commands (deterministic, no AI)
- The orchestrator treats only these top-level commands as deterministic: `/help`, `/status`, `/reset`, `/workflow`, `/register-project`, `/update-project`, `/remove-project`, `/setproject` (binds by DB conversation id, clears cwd/worktree override, deactivates the session with `project-changed`), `/commands`, `/init` (falls back to the selected project root when `conversation.cwd` is null), `/worktree`
- `/workflow` handles subcommands like `list`, `run`, `status`, `cancel`, `resume`, `abandon`, `approve`, `reject`, `reset-sessions`
- Update database, perform operations, return responses

**3. Orchestrator** (`packages/core/src/orchestrator/`)
- Manage AI conversations
- Load conversation + codebase context from database
- Variable substitution: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, `$ARGUMENTS`
- Session management: Create new or resume existing
- Stream AI responses to platform
- System prompt gets a "Managing Workflow Runs" section (`buildRunManagementSection` in `prompt-builder.ts`) teaching the chat agent to drive run management (`archon workflow runs/get/status/run --detach/approve/reject/abandon`) directly via bash. It is appended **only for project-scoped chats on providers without the native `manage_run` tool** (Codex/OpenCode/Copilot) — gated in `orchestrator-agent.ts` on `!scopedCaps.nativeTools`. Claude and Pi instead receive the in-process `manage_run` native tool (the prompt section would be redundant for them). This is the CLI-bash delivery path for providers that have neither native tools nor `skills:` (direct chat doesn't consume the `skills:` option — it is workflow-node-only).

**4. AI Agent Providers** (`packages/providers/src/`)
- Implement `IAgentProvider` interface
- **ClaudeProvider**: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
- **CodexProvider**: `@openai/codex-sdk`
- **PiProvider** (community, `builtIn: false`): `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` — one harness for ~20 LLM backends via `<provider>/<model>` refs (e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder`); supports extensions, skills, tool restrictions, thinking level, best-effort structured output. See `packages/docs-web/src/content/docs/getting-started/ai-assistants.md` for setup, capability matrix, and extension config.
- Streaming: `for await (const event of events) { await platform.send(event) }`

### Configuration

**Environment Variables:**

see .env.example
see .archon/config.yaml setup as needed

**Assistant Defaults:**

The system supports configuring default models and options per assistant in `.archon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  claude:
    model: sonnet  # or 'opus', 'haiku', 'claude-*', 'inherit'
    settingSources:  # Controls which CLAUDE.md, skills, commands, and agents the SDK loads
      - project      # Project-level <cwd>/.claude/ (included in default)
      - user         # User-level ~/.claude/ (included in default; omit both to restrict to project-only)
    claudeBinaryPath: /absolute/path/to/claude  # Optional: Claude Code executable.
                                                # Native binary (curl installer at
                                                # ~/.local/bin/claude), npm cli.js, or
                                                # the npm platform-package directory
                                                # (e.g. @anthropic-ai/claude-code-win32-x64)
                                                # which is auto-expanded to claude/claude.exe.
                                                # Required in compiled binaries if
                                                # CLAUDE_BIN_PATH env var is not set.
  codex:
    model: gpt-5.3-codex
    modelReasoningEffort: medium  # 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh'
    webSearchMode: live  # 'disabled' | 'cached' | 'live'
    additionalDirectories:
      - /absolute/path/to/other/repo
    codexBinaryPath: /usr/local/bin/codex  # Optional: custom Codex CLI binary path

# docs:
#   path: docs  # Optional: default is docs/

tiers:
  small:
    provider: claude
    model: haiku
  medium:
    provider: claude
    model: sonnet
  large:
    provider: codex
    model: gpt-5.5
    effort: high
```

**Configuration Priority:**
1. Workflow-level options (in YAML `model`, `modelReasoningEffort`, etc.)
2. Config file defaults (`.archon/config.yaml` `assistants.*`)
3. SDK defaults

**Model Validation:**
- Workflows are validated at load time for provider _identity_ only — `provider:` (workflow-level and per-node) must be a registered provider id, otherwise the YAML is rejected with `Unknown provider '<id>'. Registered: claude, codex, pi`.
- Model strings are classified by `resolveModelSpec()` in `packages/workflows/src/model-validation.ts`: tier keywords (`small`/`medium`/`large`) resolve via built-in defaults plus `tiers:` overrides; `@<name>` refs resolve via the merged alias map from config; anything else remains a literal SDK model string.
- Tier and alias refs can resolve provider, model, and provider-specific options. Literal model strings keep the normal provider chain (`node.provider ?? workflow.provider ?? config.assistant`).
- `tiers:` and `aliases:` are valid on global and repo config (repo overrides global). Reserved names `small`, `medium`, `large` cannot be used as custom alias names. Custom alias keys must start with `@` (e.g. `@fast`).

### Running the App in Worktrees

Agents working in worktrees can run the app for self-testing (make changes → run app → test via curl → fix). Ports are automatically allocated to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Run in worktree (port auto-allocated based on path)
bun dev &
# [Hono] Worktree detected (/path/to/worktree)
# [Hono] Auto-allocated port: 3637 (base: 3090, offset: +547)

# Test via web API (production path)
# 1) Create a conversation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3637/api/conversations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# 2) Send a message
curl -X POST http://localhost:3637/api/conversations/<conversationId>/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"/status"}'

# 3) Fetch messages (polling)
curl http://localhost:3637/api/conversations/<conversationId>/messages

# Note: SSE streaming is available at /api/stream/<conversationId>
```

**Port Allocation:**
- Worktrees: Automatic unique port (3190-4089 range, hash-based on path)
- Main repo: Default 3090
- Override: `PORT=4000 bun dev` (works in both contexts)
- Same worktree always gets same port (deterministic)

**Important:**
- Use the web API routes for manual validation (avoid running multiple platform adapters)
- Database is shared (same conversations/codebases available)
- Kill the server when done: `pkill -f "bun.*dev"` or use the specific port

## Development Guidelines

### UI and Visual Design

All UI changes — production web (`packages/web/`), experiments (`packages/web/src/experiments/`), the docs site, marketing surfaces, and any future visual surface — must align with the Archon brand foundation.

- **Canonical brand guide:** https://archon.diy/brand/ (source: `packages/docs-web/src/content/docs/brand/index.md` + `packages/docs-web/public/brand/foundation.html`).
- **Use brand tokens, not ad-hoc values.** Colors, gradients, surfaces, and typography must come from the established design tokens (`packages/web/src/index.css`) or the brand guide. Don't hard-code hex values that aren't in the system.
- **Introducing a new visual token** (color, font, radius, spacing) means updating both the token source and the brand guide. Don't fork the palette per package.
- **When in doubt, consult the brand guide first** before inventing new visual treatments. Open a discussion if the guide doesn't cover your case.

### When Creating New Features

**Quick reference:**
- **Platform Adapters**: Implement `IPlatformAdapter`, handle auth, polling/webhooks
- **AI Providers**: Implement `IAgentProvider`, session management, streaming
- **Slash Commands**: Add to command-handler.ts, update database, no AI
- **Database Operations**: Use `IDatabase` interface (supports PostgreSQL and SQLite via adapters)
- **Plan insertion points**: Use stable text anchors (e.g., "after the `it('throws on ...')` test block"), never raw line numbers — line numbers drift on every preceding edit.

### SDK Type Patterns

When working with external SDKs (Claude Agent SDK, Codex SDK), prefer importing and using SDK types directly:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Import SDK types directly
import { query, type Options } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

const options: Options = {
  cwd,
  permissionMode: 'bypassPermissions',
  // ...
};

// Use type assertions for SDK response structures
const message = msg as { message: { content: ContentBlock[] } };
```

```typescript
// ❌ AVOID - Defining duplicate types
interface MyQueryOptions {  // Don't duplicate SDK types
  cwd: string;
  // ...
}
const options: MyQueryOptions = { ... };
query({ prompt, options: options as any });  // Avoid 'as any'
```

This ensures type compatibility with SDK updates and eliminates `as any` casts.

### Testing

**Unit Tests:**
- Test pure functions (variable substitution, command parsing)
- Mock external dependencies (database, AI SDKs, platform APIs)

**Integration Tests:**
- Test database operations with test database
- Test end-to-end flows (mock platforms/AI but use real orchestrator)
- Clean up test data after each test

**Mock isolation rules (IMPORTANT):**
- Bun's `mock.module()` is process-global and irreversible — `mock.restore()` does NOT undo it
- Do NOT add `afterAll(() => mock.restore())` for `mock.module()` cleanup — it has no effect
- Use `spyOn()` for internal modules that other test files import directly (e.g., `spyOn(git, 'checkout')`) — `spy.mockRestore()` DOES work for spies
- Never `mock.module()` a module path that another test file also `mock.module()`s with a different implementation
- When adding a new test file with `mock.module()`, ensure its package.json test script runs it in a separate `bun test` invocation from any conflicting files

**Manual Validation:** Use the web API (`curl`) or CLI commands directly for end-to-end testing of new features.

### Logging

**Structured logging with Pino** (`packages/paths/src/logger.ts`):

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@archon/paths';

const log = createLogger('orchestrator');

// Event naming: {domain}.{action}_{state}
// Standard states: _started, _completed, _failed, _validated, _rejected
async function createSession(conversationId: string, codebaseId: string) {
  log.info({ conversationId, codebaseId }, 'session.create_started');

  try {
    const session = await doCreate();
    log.info({ conversationId, codebaseId, sessionId: session.id }, 'session.create_completed');
    return session;
  } catch (e) {
    const err = e as Error;
    log.error(
      { conversationId, error: err.message, errorType: err.constructor.name, err },
      'session.create_failed',
    );
    throw err;
  }
}
```

**Event naming rules:**
- Format: `{domain}.{action}_{state}` — e.g. `workflow.step_started`, `isolation.create_failed`
- Avoid generic events like `processing` or `handling`
- Always pair `_started` with `_completed` or `_failed`
- Include context: IDs, durations, error details

**Log Levels:** `fatal` > `error` > `warn` > `info` (default) > `debug` > `trace`

**Verbosity:**
- CLI: `archon --quiet` (errors only) — suppresses Pino logs and workflow progress output
- CLI: `archon --verbose` (debug) — enables debug Pino logs and tool-level workflow progress events
- Server: `LOG_LEVEL=debug bun run start`

**Never log:** API keys or tokens (mask: `token.slice(0, 8) + '...'`), user message content, PII.

### Command System

**Variable Substitution:**
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3` - Positional arguments
- `$ARGUMENTS` - All arguments as single string
- `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` - External artifacts directory for the current workflow run (pre-created by executor)
- `$WORKFLOW_ID` - The workflow run ID
- `$BASE_BRANCH` - Base branch; auto-detected from git when `worktree.baseBranch` is not set; fails only if referenced in a prompt and auto-detection also fails
- `$DOCS_DIR` - Documentation directory path; configured via `docs.path` in `.archon/config.yaml`. Defaults to `docs/`. Never throws.
- `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` - User feedback provided via `/workflow approve <id> <text>` at an interactive loop gate. Only populated on the first iteration of a resumed interactive loop; empty string on all other iterations.
- `$REJECTION_REASON` - Reviewer feedback provided via `/workflow reject <id> <reason>` at an approval gate. Only populated in `on_reject` prompts; empty string elsewhere.
- `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT` - Cleaned output of the previous loop iteration (loop nodes only). Empty string on the first iteration (no prior output exists). Useful for `fresh_context: true` loops that need to reference what the previous pass produced or why it failed without carrying full session history.

**Command Types:**

1. **Codebase Commands** (per-repo):
   - Stored in `.archon/commands/` (plain text/markdown)
   - Discovered from the repository `.archon/commands/` directory
   - Surfaced via `GET /api/commands` for the workflow builder and invoked by workflow `command:` nodes

2. **Workflows** (YAML-based):
   - Stored in `.archon/workflows/` (searched recursively)
   - Multi-step AI execution chains, discovered at runtime
   - **`nodes:` (DAG format)**: Nodes with explicit `depends_on` edges; independent nodes in the same topological layer run concurrently. Node types: `command:` (named command file), `prompt:` (inline prompt), `bash:` (shell script, stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`, no AI, receives managed per-project env vars in its subprocess environment when configured), `loop:` (iterative AI prompt until completion signal), `loop_group:` (multi-node sub-DAG body repeated per iteration until `until` signal / `until_bash` exit 0 / `max_iterations`; body is sealed for `depends_on` but may read outer outputs via `$nodeId.output` and the previous iteration via `$LOOP_PREV.<nodeId>.output`; a failed body node fails the group immediately; group-level `model`/`provider` become body defaults), `approval:` (human gate; pauses until user approves or rejects; `capture_response: true` stores the user's comment as `$<node-id>.output` for downstream nodes, default false), `script:` (inline TypeScript/Python or named script from `.archon/scripts/`, runs via `bun` or `uv`, stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`, no AI, receives managed per-project env vars in its subprocess environment when configured, supports `deps:` for dependency installation and `timeout:` in ms, requires `runtime: bun` or `runtime: uv`) . Supports `when:` conditions, `trigger_rule` join semantics, `$nodeId.output` substitution, `output_format` for structured JSON output (SDK-enforced on Claude/Codex/OpenCode; best-effort prompt-augmentation + repair on Pi/Copilot — the parsed output is **validated against the declared schema for every provider**, best-effort providers (Pi/Copilot) re-ask up to 3× on a validation miss, and a node that declares `output_format` but returns no schema-valid output **fails** rather than degrading silently; `$nodeId.output.field` access is strict — a field not in the producer's schema, or a schemaless node whose output isn't JSON / lacks the key, fails the consuming node, while an author-declared-optional field resolves to `''`), `allowed_tools`/`denied_tools` for per-node tool restrictions (Claude only), `hooks` for per-node SDK hook callbacks (Claude only), `mcp` for per-node MCP server config files (Claude only, env vars expanded at execution time), and `skills` for per-node skill preloading via AgentDefinition wrapping (Claude only for per-node injection; Codex supports skills via filesystem auto-discovery from `.agents/skills/` — the `skills:` list is informational for Codex nodes), `agents` for inline sub-agent definitions invokable via the Task tool (Claude only), and `effort`/`thinking`/`maxBudgetUsd`/`systemPrompt`/`fallbackModel`/`betas`/`sandbox` for Claude SDK advanced options (Claude only, also settable at workflow level), and `persist_session` for cross-run provider session continuity (node-level opt-in; workflow-level default via `persist_sessions: true`; requires a provider with the `sessionResume` capability), and `output_type` (any node type) for engine-written typed output sidecars — when set, the executor writes `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/nodes/<id>.md` + `<id>.meta.json` after the node completes (best-effort) so downstream nodes and later runs can locate output by type instead of guessing filenames
   - Workflow-level `requires: [github]` hard-blocks invocation (before any worktree/clone/AI cost) when the originating user hasn't connected their GitHub identity — enforced only when per-user GitHub is enabled (GitHub App + `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); a no-op for solo PAT installs
   - Provider inherited from `.archon/config.yaml` unless explicitly set; per-node `provider` and `model` overrides supported
   - Model and options can be set per workflow or inherited from config defaults
   - `interactive: true` at the workflow level forces foreground execution on web (required for approval-gate workflows in the web UI)
   - Model validation ensures provider/model compatibility at load time
   - Commands: `/workflow list`, `/workflow reload`, `/workflow status`, `/workflow cancel`, `/workflow resume <id>` (re-runs failed workflow, skipping completed nodes), `/workflow abandon <id>`, `/workflow cleanup [days]` (CLI only — deletes old run records), `/workflow reset-sessions <name> [<node-id>]` (clears persisted `persist_session` memory; chat auto-scopes to the current conversation, CLI adds `--scope`/`--yes` for cross-scope control)
   - Resilient loading: One broken YAML doesn't abort discovery; errors shown in `/workflow list`
   - `resolveWorkflowName()` (in `router.ts`) resolves workflow names via a 4-tier fallback — exact, case-insensitive, suffix (`-name`), substring — with ambiguity detection; used by both the CLI and all chat platforms
   - Router fallback: if no `/invoke-workflow` is produced, falls back to `archon-assist` (with "Routing unclear" notice); raw AI response returned only when `archon-assist` is unavailable
   - Claude routing calls use `tools: []` to prevent tool use at the API level; Codex tool bypass is detected and triggers the same fallback

**Defaults:**
- Bundled in `.archon/commands/defaults/` and `.archon/workflows/defaults/`
- Binary builds: Embedded at compile time (no filesystem access needed) via `packages/workflows/src/defaults/bundled-defaults.generated.ts`
- Source builds: Loaded from filesystem at runtime
- Merged with repo-specific commands/workflows (repo overrides defaults by name)
- Opt-out: Set `defaults.loadDefaultCommands: false` or `defaults.loadDefaultWorkflows: false` in `.archon/config.yaml`
- **After adding, removing, or editing a default file, run `bun run generate:bundled`** to refresh the embedded bundle. After editing `migrations/000_combined.sql`, run `bun run generate:bundled-schema` to keep the embedded schema in sync, AND mirror any new table into `createSchema()` in `packages/core/src/db/adapters/sqlite.ts` — the SQLite schema is hand-maintained separately and is NOT generated from the migration; the only intentional Postgres-only exception is the `remote_agent_auth_*` Better Auth tables, and the schema-parity test in `sqlite.test.ts` fails CI on any other drift. After a `@earendil-works/pi-ai` upgrade, run `bun run generate:pi-vendor-map` to regenerate the Pi backend → env-var map + credential specs from the installed SDK (a new upstream backend must be classified in `scripts/generate-pi-vendor-map.ts`). `bun run validate` (and CI) run `check:bundled`, `check:bundled-skill`, `check:bundled-schema`, and `check:pi-vendor-map` and will fail loudly if any generated file is stale.

**Home-scoped ("global") workflows, commands, and scripts** (user-level, applies to every project):
- Workflows: `~/.archon/workflows/` (or `$ARCHON_HOME/workflows/`)
- Commands: `~/.archon/commands/` (or `$ARCHON_HOME/commands/`)
- Scripts: `~/.archon/scripts/` (or `$ARCHON_HOME/scripts/`)
- Source label: `source: 'global'` on workflows and commands (scripts don't have a source label)
- Load priority: bundled < global < project (repo overrides global by filename or script name)
- Subfolders: supported 1 level deep (e.g. `~/.archon/workflows/triage/foo.yaml`). Deeper nesting is ignored silently.
- Discovery is automatic — `discoverWorkflowsWithConfig(cwd, loadConfig)` and `discoverScriptsForCwd(cwd)` both read home-scoped paths unconditionally; no caller option needed
- **Migration from pre-0.x `~/.archon/.archon/workflows/`**: if Archon detects files at the old location it emits a one-time WARN with the exact `mv` command and does NOT load from there. Move with: `mv ~/.archon/.archon/workflows ~/.archon/workflows && rmdir ~/.archon/.archon`
- See the docs site at `packages/docs-web/` for details

### Error Handling

**Database Errors:**
```typescript
// INSERT operations
try {
  await db.query('INSERT INTO conversations ...', params);
} catch (error) {
  log.error({ err: error, params }, 'db_insert_failed');
  throw new Error('Failed to create conversation');
}

// UPDATE operations - verify rowCount to catch missing records
try {
  await db.updateConversation(conversationId, { codebase_id: codebaseId });
} catch (error) {
  // updateConversation throws if no rows matched (conversation not found)
  log.error({ err: error, conversationId }, 'db_update_failed');
  throw error; // Re-throw to surface the issue
}
```

**Git Operation Errors (don't fail silently):**
```typescript
// When isolation environment creation fails:
try {
  // ... isolation creation logic ...
} catch (error) {
  const err = error as Error;
  const userMessage = classifyIsolationError(err);
  log.error({ err, codebaseId, codebaseName }, 'isolation_creation_failed');
  await platform.sendMessage(conversationId, userMessage);
}
```

Pattern: Use `classifyIsolationError()` (from `@archon/isolation`) to map git errors (permission denied, timeout, no space, not a git repo) to user-friendly messages. Always log the raw error for debugging and send a classified message to the user.

### API Endpoints

**Web UI REST API** (`packages/server/src/routes/api.ts`):

**Workflow Management:**
- `GET /api/workflows` - List available workflows; optional `?cwd=`; returns `{ workflows: [...], errors?: [...] }`
- `POST /api/workflows/validate` - Validate a workflow definition in-memory (no save); body: `{ definition: object }`; returns `{ valid: boolean, errors?: string[] }`
- `GET /api/workflows/:name` - Fetch a single workflow by name; optional `?cwd=` query param; returns `{ workflow, filename, source: 'project' | 'bundled' }`
- `PUT /api/workflows/:name` - Save (create or update) a workflow YAML; body: `{ definition: object }`; validates before writing; requires `?cwd=` or registered codebase
- `DELETE /api/workflows/:name` - Delete a user-defined workflow; bundled defaults cannot be deleted
- `DELETE /api/workflows/:name/node-sessions` - Reset persisted per-node provider sessions; optional `?scope=` and `?node=` narrow the deletion; omitting `?scope=` is a cross-scope wipe and requires `?confirm=all-scopes`; returns `{ success, deleted }`

**Workflow Run Lifecycle:**
- `POST /api/workflows/runs/{runId}/resume` - Resume a failed run from where it left off (skips already-completed DAG nodes; AI session context is not restored).
- `POST /api/workflows/runs/{runId}/abandon` - Abandon a non-terminal run (marks as cancelled)
- `DELETE /api/workflows/runs/{runId}` - Delete a terminal workflow run and its events

**Codebases:**
- `GET /api/codebases` / `GET /api/codebases/:id` - List / fetch codebases
- `POST /api/codebases` - Register a codebase (clone or local path). A non-git local `path` now auto-registers as a folder project (`kind: 'folder'`, runs in place) instead of erroring
- `DELETE /api/codebases/:id` - Delete a codebase and clean up resources
- `GET /api/codebases/:id/env` - List env var keys for a codebase (never returns values)
- `PUT /api/codebases/:id/env` / `DELETE /api/codebases/:id/env/:key` - Upsert / delete a single codebase env var
- `GET /api/codebases/:id/environments` - List tracked isolation environments for a codebase

**Artifact Files:**
- `GET /api/runs/:runId/artifacts` - List artifact files for a run; walks the on-disk artifact directory (dotfiles skipped) and returns `{ files: [{ path, size, modifiedAt }] }`; 400 on invalid run id or path-escape attempt, 404 if the run does not exist
- `GET /api/artifacts/:runId/*` - Serve a workflow artifact file by run ID and relative path; returns `text/markdown` for `.md` files, `text/plain` otherwise; 400 on path traversal (`..`), 404 if run or file not found

**Command Listing:**
- `GET /api/commands` - List available command names (bundled + project-defined); optional `?cwd=`; returns `{ commands: [{ name, source: 'bundled' | 'project' }] }`

**Providers:**
- `GET /api/providers` - List registered AI providers; returns `{ providers: [{ id, displayName, capabilities, builtIn }] }`. `capabilities.nativeTools` is `true` for providers that accept in-process native tools (Claude, Pi) — Archon's `manage_run` tool is auto-injected into project-scoped chat for those providers only. `capabilities.structuredOutput` is a tiered union `'enforced' | 'best-effort' | false` (not a boolean): `'enforced'` = SDK/backend grammar-constrained (Claude/Codex/OpenCode), `'best-effort'` = prompt-augmentation + validate (Pi/Copilot), `false` = unsupported.

**Web Auth (opt-in Better Auth; Postgres + `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`):**
- Better Auth mounts email/password login at `/api/auth/*` (sign-up/sign-in/sign-out/get-session). Mounted only when enabled; the catch-all explicitly falls through (`isArchonOwnedAuthPath` in `auth/config.ts`, guard-tested) for Archon-owned `/api/auth/status` + `/api/auth/github*` + `/api/auth/providers*` + `/api/auth/me/ai-prefs*` paths so they aren't shadowed (a missing exemption 404s the route — see #1918).
- `GET /api/auth/status` - Web auth availability + signup posture (no auth required); returns `{ enabled: boolean, signup: 'allowlist' | 'open' | 'disabled' }`. Drives the Web UI login gate.
- The per-request identity seam is `resolveAuthContext(c): { userId, role } | undefined` (in `routes/api.ts`): Better Auth session first, then the `X-Archon-User` header, then undefined. `resolveWebUserId` delegates to it; `requireWebUser` is the session-aware strict variant (401 missing / 503 backend). `role` rides the canonical user row (default `admin`).
- **Server-side API gate** (`isApiGateEnabled`): when web auth is enabled, every `/api/*` request must resolve to an identity or gets **401** — except `/api/auth/*` (login surface) and `/api/health*` (healthcheck must stay reachable). `/webhooks/*` and `/internal/*` are outside `/api/*` and untouched. On by default; `ARCHON_WEB_AUTH_REQUIRED=false` keeps login-UI-only. This is what lets Better Auth replace the Caddy `forward_auth` sidecar as the real access boundary.
- **Signup safety** (`getSignupMode`): with web auth on and no `ARCHON_AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAILS`, signup defaults to **disabled** (login only) + a boot WARN — never silently open. `ARCHON_AUTH_OPEN_SIGNUP=true` opts into open public signup.
- `GET /api/workflows/runs?mine=true` and `GET /api/conversations?mine=true` - Non-enforcing "my" filter (narrows to `ctx.userId` only when an identity resolves; default lists everything). Not a security boundary.

**GitHub Identity (per-user device flow; App mode + `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`):**
- `POST /api/auth/github/device/start` - Begin the device flow for the current web user (from `X-Archon-User`); returns `{ device_code, user_code, verification_uri, interval, expires_in }`; 401 if no web-auth header
- `POST /api/auth/github/device/poll` - Single non-blocking poll; body `{ device_code }`; returns `{ status: 'pending' | 'connected' | 'expired' | 'denied' | 'error', githubLogin?, detail? }`
- `GET /api/auth/github` - Connection status for the current web user; returns `{ connected, githubLogin }`
- `DELETE /api/auth/github` - Disconnect the current web user's GitHub identity

**AI-Provider Keys (per-user; `requireWebUser`):**
- `GET /api/auth/providers` - List the current web user's connected provider keys; returns `{ enabled, connections: [{ provider, kind, label }], available: string[], subscriptionAvailable: string[], agents: [...] }` (no secret values; `available` = registry-derived connectable **vendor** catalog, `subscriptionAvailable` = subset that supports OAuth login; `enabled` is always `true` — vault is auto-provisioned). `agents` (#1955) is the agent → credential matrix: per registered agent `{ id, displayName, catalog: 'static'|'dynamic', ready, credentials: [{ vendor, displayName, kinds, connected, subscriptionAvailable, installEnv, ambientConfigured? }] }` — `installEnv`/`ambientConfigured` report server-env detection so readiness works on solo installs too; OpenCode is `catalog:'dynamic'` (introspect via the endpoint below). `requireWebUser` (401 without identity)
- `PUT /api/auth/providers/:provider` - Connect (upsert) an API key by **vendor id** (legacy `claude`/`codex`/`copilot` accepted + normalized); body `{ apiKey, label? }`; returns `{ success, provider: <vendor>, kind: 'api_key', label }` (never echoes the key). 400 on unknown vendor / blank key, 404 when per-user keys disabled, 500 (opaque) on storage failure
- `DELETE /api/auth/providers/:provider` - Disconnect a credential (idempotent, vendor-normalized); returns `{ success }`. 404 when disabled
- `POST /api/auth/providers/:provider/oauth/start` - Begin a subscription (OAuth) login (`anthropic`/`openai`/`github-copilot`); returns `{ sessionId, mode: 'manual'|'device', url?, userCode?, verificationUri?, expiresIn }` (no secret). 400 non-subscription vendor, 404 disabled, 503 when a previous login still holds the OAuth callback port (#1963 — retryable). Held server-side by the `oauth-bridge`: Pi's `login()` for anthropic/github-copilot; an Archon-OWNED PKCE flow for openai/ChatGPT (`openai-oauth.ts` — captures the `id_token` Pi drops, manual-paste only with no local callback server, #1924). `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` (in `oauth-providers.ts`) is the single source of truth.
- `POST /api/auth/providers/:provider/oauth/poll` - Poll the login session; body `{ sessionId, code? }` (`code` = pasted manual-code); returns `{ status: 'pending'|'connected'|'error', detail? }`. Session bound to the caller's userId.
- Credentials (API keys + subscriptions) injected into runs/chat env at execution time (vault always active — `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` overrides the auto-key on managed deploys). Subscription tokens refresh-on-read and re-save on rotation. Subscriptions are delivered to native Claude/Codex (env / `CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) AND to Pi — in workflow runs via a per-run `auth.json` (`ARCHON_PI_AUTH_PATH`), and in env-only direct chat (no artifacts dir) an `anthropic` subscription rides `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the env bag, which the Pi env bridge reads ahead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (#1984).

**Per-User AI Prefs (Phase 3; `requireWebUser` — identity only, NO `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`):**
- `GET /api/auth/me/ai-prefs` - The current user's stored prefs (raw per-user layer, not merged with config); returns `{ tiers?, aliases?, defaultProvider? }`. 401 without identity — the console hides "Just me" on failure.
- `PATCH /api/auth/me/ai-prefs/tiers` / `…/aliases` - Per-key merge writes (`null` unsets); validate provider via `isRegisteredProvider`, effort via `isEffortValidForProvider`, alias names (`@` prefix, not a reserved tier keyword). All return the updated prefs.
- `PATCH /api/auth/me/ai-prefs/default` - Set the personal default assistant + default chat model: `{ provider, model? }` written ATOMICALLY (omitted `model` clears any pin; `model` without `provider` → 400; `provider: null` clears both). Chat model precedence (#1998, chat call-site only): user `default_model` (provider must match) → configured `large` tier (user > repo > global) → install `assistants.<p>.model` (beats only the built-in tier default) → built-in tier default.
- Stored in `remote_agent_user_ai_prefs` (non-encrypted); folded into `buildAiProfile` as the **highest-precedence** layer (global < repo < user) at the userId-aware seams — workflow executor (`deps.getUserAiPrefs`, resolved from the run starter) and chat orchestrator (sender-first: `executionUserId = context.userId ?? conversation.user_id` — the SENDER's prefs and credentials win; the conversation creator is only the fallback when no sender identity resolves, see #1982). The per-user `defaultProvider` rebases tier defaults and the chat assistant. No identity → byte-for-byte config-only behavior (solo unchanged). A chat request for tier `large` that resolves via the fallback chain emits a one-line non-blocking nudge (`orchestrator.tier_fallback_nudge`). Note: on genuinely shared threads (Slack/Telegram), per-sender prefs mean the provider can differ per turn within one thread (session transitions churn accordingly), and a sender's turn carries the shared thread history into a call billed to their credential — accepted semantics.

**Config (System; ungated — works on solo installs, NOT `requireWebUser`):**
- `GET /api/config` - Read-only safe config; returns `{ config, database }`. `config` includes `tiers` (configured small/medium/large presets), `tierDefaults` (built-in presets for the default provider, computed via `buildAiProfile` — lets the UI show what an unset tier resolves to), and `aliases` (configured `@custom` aliases, merged repo > global).
- `PATCH /api/config/assistants` - Update default assistant + per-provider model defaults.
- `PATCH /api/config/tiers` - Update model-tier presets; body `{ tiers: { small?, medium?, large? } }` where each tier is `{ provider, model, effort? }` or `null` (unset). Per-key merge; validates each `provider` via `isRegisteredProvider`. Writes `~/.archon/config.yaml`. Drives the console "AI Settings → Model Tiers" panel + `archon ai tier` CLI.
- `PATCH /api/config/aliases` - Update `@custom` model aliases; body `{ aliases: Record<'@name', entry | null> }`. Same per-key merge + validation as `/tiers`, plus alias-name checks (`@` prefix, not reserved). Drives the console "Model Aliases" panel + `archon ai alias` CLI.
- `GET /api/providers/pi/models` - Pi's model catalog (`{ models: [{ ref, provider, id, name, reasoning, cost, contextWindow }] }`) for the tier picker's cost/reasoning hint. Best-effort: returns `{ models: [] }` on any catalog failure — never blocks tier/alias saves.
- `GET /api/providers/opencode/credentials` - Introspect OpenCode's backend providers (#1955): proxies the embedded server's `GET /provider` + `/provider/auth`; returns `{ providers: [{ id, name, env, connected, modelCount, authMethods }] }` (metadata only; `connected` is install-wide — OpenCode's auth store is server-global). **Heavyweight**: starts the embedded OpenCode runtime when not already running — call on demand from the settings card, never on passive page load. 503 (never a silent `[]`) when the runtime is unavailable.

**System:**
- `GET /api/health` - Health check with adapter/system status
- `GET /api/update-check` - Check for available updates; returns `{ updateAvailable, currentVersion, latestVersion, releaseUrl }`; skips GitHub API call for non-binary builds

**OpenAPI Spec:**
- `GET /api/openapi.json` - Generated OpenAPI 3.0 spec for all Zod-validated routes

**Webhooks:**
- `POST /webhooks/github` - GitHub webhook events
- Signature verification required (HMAC SHA-256)
- Return 200 immediately, process async

**Internal (App mode only; bind 127.0.0.1):**
- `POST /internal/git-credential` - Git credential helper endpoint. Returns `{token}` for the installation matching the requested host/path. Used by the `git-credential-archon` script in worktree `.git/config` to refresh installation tokens for long-running workflow `git` operations. Hands out installation tokens — MUST NOT be exposed beyond loopback. Server **refuses to start** (not just WARN) if App mode is active and `hostname != 127.0.0.1/localhost`, unless `ARCHON_ALLOW_INTERNAL_ON_PUBLIC_BIND=1` is set as an opt-in escape hatch for deployments where the reverse proxy already drops `/internal/*`.

**Security:**
- Verify webhook signatures (GitHub: `X-Hub-Signature-256`)
- Use `c.req.text()` for raw webhook body (signature verification)
- Never log or expose tokens in responses
- `/internal/*` paths hand out live credentials — the reverse proxy in production MUST drop them, or the server MUST bind to `127.0.0.1` only.

**@Mention Detection:**
- Parse `@archon` in issue/PR **comments only** (not descriptions)
- Events: `issue_comment` only
- Note: Descriptions often contain example commands or documentation - these are NOT command invocations (see #96)
